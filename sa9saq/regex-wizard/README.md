# 🧙 regex-wizard

Turn plain English into regex — and regex into plain English.

## Features

- Natural language → regex generation
- Regex → plain English explanation (token-by-token breakdown)
- Live testing against sample strings with match highlighting
- Supports multiple flavors (Python, JS, PCRE)
- Warns about common pitfalls (greedy matching, backtracking)

## Usage Examples

- "Write a regex to match email addresses"
- "Explain this regex: `^(?:\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}$`"
- "Test `/\b\w+ing\b/` against these words: running, sing, thing, go"

## Requirements

- Shell access (for live testing via `python` or `node`)
