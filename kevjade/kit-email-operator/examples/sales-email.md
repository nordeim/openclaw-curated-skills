**The Process:**

**Week 1: Deep Dive Audit**
• I go through your signup flow, product tour, email sequences
• I identify friction points and drop-off areas
• I analyze your analytics (if available)

**Week 2: Strategy Session (2 hours)**
• I present my findings and recommendations
• We prioritize the highest-impact changes
• I create a 90-day implementation roadmap

**Average ROI:** 8-12x investment within 6 months

---

**Investment: $8,500**

(Payment plan available: 3 monthly payments of $2,995)

**What happens next:**

1. You reply to this email with "Interested"
2. I send you a short questionnaire (10 minutes)
3. We schedule a 30-minute fit call
4. If we're a good match, we kick off Week 1

**Important:** I only take 3 clients per quarter. I'm announcing this to my entire list (1,200 people), so spots will fill fast.

If you're interested, reply now.

---

**Is This Right for You?**

✅ You're a B2B or B2C SaaS company  
✅ You have product-market fit (some happy customers)  
✅ You have at least 50 trials/month  
✅ Your trial-to-paid is below 20% (industry avg)  
✅ You're committed to implementing changes

---

**Not ready yet?**

No problem. Stay on the list. I share free strategies every week.

But if you're serious about improving your onboarding **and you have the budget**, this is the fastest way to get results.

Reply with "Interested" and let's chat.

Hey {{ subscriber.first_name }},

**I'm hosting a FREE live training on Thursday, February 25 at 2 PM EST:**

**"How to Build Your First 1,000 Email Subscribers in 90 Days (Without Ads)"**

This is for you if:
• You have less than 1,000 subscribers (or none)
• You're trying to grow organically (no budget for ads)
• You've tried lead magnets but they're not working
• You feel stuck at <100 subscribers

**Here's what we'll cover (90 minutes):**

📌 **The 3 list-building strategies that actually work in 2026**
(No, it's not "create a lead magnet"—everyone does that)

📌 **The "Content Flywheel" method**
How to turn one piece of content into 7 subscriber sources

📌 **Why your lead magnet isn't working** (and how to fix it in 24 hours)

📌 **The 10-minute-per-day system**
Grow your list without spending all day on "marketing"

📌 **Live Q&A + hot-seat coaching**
Bring your questions. I'll help you personally.

---

**What You'll Walk Away With:**

✅ A complete 90-day action plan  
✅ Specific tactics you can start using TODAY  
✅ Templates and examples (I'll share my screen)  
✅ Feedback on YOUR strategy (if you want it)

---

**When:** Thursday, February 25, 2 PM EST (11 AM PST)  
**Where:** Zoom (link sent after registration)  
**Cost:** FREE

**Can't make it live?**

Register anyway! I'll send the replay to everyone who registers.

(But try to come live—the Q&A and hot-seats are the best part.)

---

**What People Are Saying:**

> "Sarah's workshop was a game-changer. I implemented her strategies and grew from 50 → 500 subscribers in 6 weeks."  
> **— Michael P.**

> "Finally, strategies that don't require a huge budget. This is perfect for solopreneurs."  
> **— Jordan K.**

---

**Fair warning:**

At the end of the workshop, I'll introduce my Email Marketing Accelerator program. It's optional—you'll get value either way—but if you've been thinking about joining, this is a great preview.

**No hard sell. Just helpful training + an invite.**

Sound good?

See you Thursday!

## Sales Email Best Practices

### When to Send Sales Emails

**After Nurture:**
- 4-6 value emails → 1 sales email (80/20 rule)

**Launch Sequences:**
- Pre-launch (3-5 emails) → Launch (5-7 sales emails over 7 days)

**Promotions:**
- 1-2 sales emails during promotion period
- Always include end date

**Rule:** More value = more permission to sell

---

### Email Length for Sales

**Short (150-250 words):**
- E-commerce promotions
- Simple offers
- Flash sales
- Retargeting

**Medium (250-500 words):**
- Standard product launches
- Service offers
- Event registrations

**Long (500-800 words):**
- High-ticket offers ($500+)
- Complex services
- Detailed explanations needed

**Rule:** Higher price = longer email (need to overcome more objections)

---

### Essential Elements

Every sales email MUST have:

1. ✅ **Clear offer:** What are you selling?
2. ✅ **Price:** Don't make them guess
3. ✅ **Value:** Why is it worth the price?
4. ✅ **Social proof:** Who else bought/used it?
5. ✅ **Risk reversal:** Guarantee, trial, refund
6. ✅ **Urgency:** Why buy now vs. later?
7. ✅ **CTA:** One primary button/link

**Missing any = lower conversion**

---

### Objection Handling

**Common objections to address:**

**"It's too expensive"**
→ Show ROI, payment plans, compare to alternatives

**"I don't have time"**
→ Show time savings, quick implementation

**"Will this work for me?"**
→ Qualification criteria, testimonials from similar people

**"What if I don't like it?"**
→ Guarantee, trial period, cancellation policy

**"I need to think about it"**
→ Urgency (deadline), scarcity (limited spots)

**Address objections BEFORE they arise**

---

### CTA Best Practices

**Button text formulas:**

❌ **Generic:**
- "Buy Now"
- "Click Here"
- "Learn More"

✅ **Specific & Benefit-Driven:**
- "Enroll Now & Save $500"
- "Get [Product Name] Today"
- "Yes, I Want [Outcome]"
- "Start My Free Trial"
- "Book My Strategy Call"

**Placement:**
- Primary CTA: Above the fold
- Secondary CTAs: Mid-email, bottom
- Repeat CTA 2-3 times (long emails)

---

### Urgency & Scarcity

**Genuine Urgency:**
✅ Sale ends [specific date/time]  
✅ Limited spots [actual number]  
✅ Bonus expires [deadline]  
✅ Early-bird pricing [tier pricing]

**Fake Urgency (Avoid):**
❌ Evergreen countdown timers  
❌ "Only 2 left!" (false)  
❌ Repeated "last chance" (but not really)

**Rule:** Only use urgency if it's REAL. Fake urgency destroys trust.

---

### A/B Testing for Sales Emails

**Test priority:**

1. **Subject line** (personalized vs. urgency vs. benefit)
2. **Email length** (short vs. long)
3. **CTA placement** (top vs. mid vs. bottom)
4. **Price presentation** (regular vs. strikethrough vs. payment plan)
5. **Social proof type** (testimonials vs. stats vs. case studies)

**Minimum sample:** 1,000 per variant  
**Test duration:** Full campaign period  
**Measure:** Click rate AND conversion rate (not just opens)

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Too many CTAs:** Confuses the buyer (one offer, one CTA)  
❌ **No urgency:** "I'll buy later" = never buys  
❌ **Hidden price:** Makes people suspicious  
❌ **No social proof:** "Am I the first buyer?"  
❌ **No risk reversal:** "What if it doesn't work?"  
❌ **Vague value:** "This will change your life" (how?)  
❌ **No segmentation:** Same pitch to everyone  

---

## Performance Benchmarks

**Open Rates:**
- Warm list: 25-40%
- Launch sequence: 30-50%
- Flash sales: 35-50%

**Click Rates:**
- Standard: 5-10%
- Launch: 10-20%
- High-urgency: 15-25%

**Conversion Rates:**
- Low-ticket (<$100): 5-15%
- Mid-ticket ($100-500): 2-8%
- High-ticket ($500+): 1-5%
- Service/Consulting: 0.5-3%

**Your results will vary based on:**
- Quality of nurture
- Strength of offer
- Price point
- Market fit

---

**Remember: Sales emails work when you've earned permission through value. Provide value first, sell second.**
