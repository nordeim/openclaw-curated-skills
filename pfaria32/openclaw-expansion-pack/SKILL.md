# OpenClaw Expansion Pack

Complete infrastructure suite for production OpenClaw deployments. Four integrated skills: Security scanner + Cost reduction (60-80%) + Self-healing quality system + Skill discovery. Transform OpenClaw from prototype to enterprise-ready.

**When to use:** Enterprise OpenClaw deployments, cost optimization, security hardening, continuous improvement

**What to know:**

## The Four Skills

Transform OpenClaw from prototype to production-ready with:

1. **Security** — Enterprise-grade protection
2. **Cost** — 60-80% token cost reduction
3. **Quality** — Self-healing through continuous analysis
4. **Ecosystem** — Skill discovery framework

**Meta Repository:** https://github.com/pfaria32/openclaw-expansion-pack (coming soon)

## The Four Skills

### 1. OpenClaw Shield (Security)
**Repository:** https://github.com/pfaria32/OpenClaw-Shield-Security

Static scanner + runtime guard + audit logging.

**Features:**
- Detects credential theft, exfiltration, destructive operations
- Runtime allowlists (file/network/exec)
- ClamAV integration (3.6M signatures)
- Hash-chained audit logs

**Impact:** Enterprise-grade security for AI agents

### 2. Token Economy (Cost Reduction)
**Repository:** https://github.com/pfaria32/open-claw-token-economy  
**DIY Fork:** https://github.com/pfaria32/openclaw

Intelligent model routing + context management.

**Features:**
- Cheap-first routing with escalation (GPT-4o → Sonnet → Opus)
- Bounded context (10k token caps)
- Zero-token heartbeats (100% elimination)
- Budget guardrails ($25/day hard cap)

**Impact:** 60-80% token cost reduction (~$60-105/month savings)

---

### 3. Recursive Self-Improvement (Continuous Learning)
**Repository:** https://github.com/pfaria32/openclaw-recursive-self-improvement

Two-tier analysis system (daily fast + weekly deep).

**Features:**
- Failure clustering and friction detection
- Cost anomaly tracking
- Structured JSONL ledgers (no DB)
- Automated improvement suggestions

**Impact:**
- 30-50% reduction in recurring errors
- 20-30% reduction in clarification loops
- 10-20% additional cost savings

**Budget:** $10-12/month

---

### 4. Capability Awareness (Skill Discovery)
**Repository:** https://github.com/pfaria32/openclaw-capability-awareness

Skills-first approach for agent capability awareness.

**Features:**
- Skill descriptions in agent prompt
- On-demand SKILL.md loading
- Zero overhead when not in use
- Foundation for skill marketplace

**Impact:** Enables OpenClaw skill ecosystem

## Installation Options

### Option A: Individual Skills
Install any skill independently:
```bash
cd /home/node/.openclaw/workspace

# Pick what you need
git clone https://github.com/pfaria32/OpenClaw-Shield-Security.git projects/OpenClaw-Shield
git clone https://github.com/pfaria32/open-claw-token-economy.git projects/token-economy
git clone https://github.com/pfaria32/openclaw-recursive-self-improvement.git projects/recursive-self-improvement
git clone https://github.com/pfaria32/openclaw-capability-awareness.git projects/capability-awareness-system
```

### Option B: Full Expansion Pack
Install all four as an integrated system:
```bash
cd /home/node/.openclaw/workspace
git clone https://github.com/pfaria32/openclaw-expansion-pack.git projects/openclaw-expansion-pack

# Run setup script (coming soon)
bash projects/openclaw-expansion-pack/setup.sh
```

## Combined Impact

**Security:** Enterprise-grade threat detection + runtime protection  
**Cost:** $60-105/month savings + 60-80% token reduction  
**Quality:** Self-healing systems, 30-50% fewer errors  
**Ecosystem:** Foundation for skill marketplace

**Total value:** Potentially saving hundreds of dollars/month while hardening security and improving quality.
