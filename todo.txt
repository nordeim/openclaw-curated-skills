please meticulously extract lines in @description.md that are crypto related or malformed description or potentially malicious lines out into another file named `suspicious_list.txt`. Also include in @suspicious_list.txt lines that may otherwise pass but contain improperly quoted `description:` field that does not meet a proper `yaml` format

  The problematic lines you need to extract would include:

  1. Crypto-related content
  2. Malformed descriptions (truncated, broken YAML)
  3. Malicious-looking or sensitive or drug-related or illegal or criminal-related or adult or harmful or pornography or violent or weapon/arm or betting/gambling content
  4. sporting-related content

  Key patterns to look for:

  • Crypto terms: token, blockchain, ETH, USDC, Solana, DeFi, NFT, smart contract, crypto, cryptocurrency, wallet, coin, mainnet, testnet, ERC-20, erc20, perp, perps, DEX, AMM, liquidity, yield, sking, borrowing, lending, vault, prediction market, polymarket, etc.
  • Malformed: descriptions that are truncated (ending with ...), contain unescaped special chars
  • Malicious: "malware", "exploit", "hack", "attack", "scam", "rug pull", "honeypot"

  You should also include lines that are considered improperly quoted YAML strings.

  Crypto-related terms to look for:

  • token, blockchain, ETH, USDC, Solana, DeFi, NFT, smart contract, crypto, cryptocurrency, wallet, coin, mainnet, testnet, ERC-20, erc20, perp, perps, DEX, AMM, liquidity, yield, staking, borrowing, lending, vault, prediction market, polymarket, etc.

  Malformed descriptions:

  • Truncated (ending with ...)
  • Unescaped special characters
  • Multi-line without proper YAML formatting

  Malicious content:

  • "malware", "exploit", "hack", "attack", "scam", "rug pull", "honeypot"

  Improperly quoted YAML:

  • Strings that should be quoted but aren't
  • Strings with special characters without quotes

  Then create the suspicious_list.txt file with the relevant lines. Now analyze the file and extract lines that are crypto-related, malformed, or potentially malicious, as well as including improperly quoted YAML description fields.
