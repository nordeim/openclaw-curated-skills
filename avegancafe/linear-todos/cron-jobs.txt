# Linear Todos Cron Jobs - EXAMPLE ONLY
# ======================================
# ⚠️  WARNING: This file contains EXAMPLE cron entries. It does NOT
#    automatically modify your crontab. Adding these is a manual
#    user action. Review before using.
#
# To add these jobs, run: crontab -e
# Then paste the entries you want (modify paths first!)

SHELL=/bin/bash
PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

# IMPORTANT: Update the path below to where YOU installed the skill:
# - If installed via clawhub: check ~/.openclaw/skills/ or ~/.clawhub/skills/
# - If cloned manually: use your clone directory
# - The path below is an EXAMPLE only and likely won't work on your system

# Morning TODO Digest (8:00 AM daily)
# Sends a fun morning greeting with today's todos
# 0 8 * * * cd /PATH/TO/YOUR/linear-todos && uv run python main.py digest

# Daily TODO Review (5:00 PM daily)
# Shows full review of todos organized by urgency
# 0 17 * * * cd /PATH/TO/YOUR/linear-todos && uv run python main.py review

# ---
# Alternative: Use OpenClaw's built-in cron instead of system crontab:
# openclaw cron add --name "morning-digest" --schedule "0 8 * * *" --command "..."
# This keeps job management within OpenClaw and avoids modifying system crontab.
