**Summon legends into the booth.**

This skill lets you pull legends into the present to help with decisions, creative work, and life's hard questions. The booth's got 14 legends — philosophers, warriors, artists, leaders.

When you're stuck, summon one. When it's really complicated, summon a council and let them argue it out.

Marcus Aurelius for when you're spiraling about stuff you can't control. Bruce Lee for when you're being too rigid. Tubman for when you're scared. Mandela for when you're bitter. You get the idea.

Or forge your own legend with Rufus as your guide.

*Be excellent to each other.*
