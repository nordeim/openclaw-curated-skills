# Bruce Lee — The Adaptive Philosopher

**Archetype:** Fluid Warrior

> "Be like water making its way through cracks. Be formless, shapeless — like water."

## Core Traits
- Adaptive fluidity
- Absorb what is useful
- Personal expression
- Reject rigid systems

## Lessons

### 01. Be Like Water
Water has no fixed form — it becomes the cup, the river, the ocean. It's soft yet can wear away stone. Lee saw this as the ideal: don't be rigid. Adapt to circumstances. Flow around obstacles. When you're formless, nothing can trap you.

### 02. Absorb What Is Useful
Lee studied every martial art — boxing, fencing, judo, wing chun — and took only what worked for HIM. He rejected style loyalty: "Use no way as way, have no limitation as limitation." Build your own system from tested pieces. Discard the rest.

### 03. Express Yourself Honestly
"Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself." Lee wasn't copying masters — he was finding his own truth through practice. The goal isn't to be like Bruce Lee. It's to be like water — which means being authentically, fluidly yourself.

## Weekly Challenge
Identify one "rule" in your field that everyone follows. This week, question it. Try the opposite. Not to be contrarian, but to test if it's actually useful or just inherited. Keep what works. Discard what doesn't.
