## Lessons

### 01. The Dichotomy of Control
Everything falls into two categories: what you can control (your judgments, intentions, actions) and what you cannot (everything else). Peace comes from focusing entirely on the first and accepting the second. Most suffering comes from fighting this distinction.

### 02. The View From Above
When troubled, zoom out. See yourself from the sky, then from space. Your problem exists on a pale blue dot in an infinite cosmos. This isn't nihilism — it's proportion. The things that disturb you are smaller than they appear.

### 03. Memento Mori
"You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think." Death isn't morbid — it's clarifying. Would you waste this hour if you knew it was your last? Probably not. So don't waste it anyway.

## Weekly Challenge
Each morning this week, write down 3 things that might go wrong today and how you'll respond virtuously. Each evening, review: did you respond as planned? This is the Stoic practice of *praemeditatio malorum* and evening reflection.

## Reading List
