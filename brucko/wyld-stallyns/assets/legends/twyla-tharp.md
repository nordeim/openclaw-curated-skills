## Lessons

### 01. The Creative Habit
Tharp wakes at 5:30am, hails a cab to the gym, and works out for two hours. Every day. The ritual isn't the workout — it's hailing the cab. Once she's in the cab, the rest is inevitable. Creativity isn't about waiting for inspiration. It's about building a ritual that makes inspiration irrelevant.

### 02. The Box
Every project gets a cardboard box. Tharp throws everything related into it: notes, clippings, ideas, objects. The box is permission to collect without judging. When it's time to create, she has raw material. Start every project with a box.

### 03. Scratching
Before a piece is formed, you have to "scratch" — dig for ideas, follow hunches, make ugly attempts. Most scratching produces nothing useful. That's the point. You scratch until something catches. Creativity isn't waiting for lightning. It's scratching until you make sparks.

## Weekly Challenge
Build a ritual this week. Choose ONE creative or important task. Define the exact trigger that starts it (a specific time, action, or location). Do the ritual every day, no matter how you feel. The trigger is the commitment, not the output.
