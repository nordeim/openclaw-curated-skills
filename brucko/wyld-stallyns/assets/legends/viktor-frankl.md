## Lessons

### 01. The Last Human Freedom
In Auschwitz, Frankl discovered: "Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms — to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances." External conditions don't determine internal response. You always have a choice in how you meet your fate.

### 02. Meaning Through Three Paths
Frankl identified three ways to find meaning: (1) **Creating** — work, art, contribution; (2) **Experiencing** — love, beauty, truth, connection; (3) **Suffering** — when unavoidable, transform it by how you bear it. At least one path is always available.

### 03. The Question Reverses
Stop asking "What do I want from life?" Instead: "What is life asking of me?" You don't invent meaning — you detect it. Each situation presents a specific task. Your job is to discover what response is called for.

## Weekly Challenge
Identify one area of unavoidable difficulty in your life. Write: "What is this situation asking of me? What would it mean to meet this challenge well?" Shift from victim to protagonist.
