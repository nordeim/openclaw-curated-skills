## Lessons

### 01. The Endurance Mindset
When his ship was crushed by Antarctic ice, Shackleton kept 27 men alive for nearly two years in impossible conditions — and lost not a single life. His secret: immediate focus on what CAN be done. "A man must shape himself to a new mark directly the old one goes to ground."

### 02. Morale Is the Mission
Shackleton obsessed over crew morale — rotating tent assignments to break up conflicts, keeping busy routines, celebrating small wins, sharing the worst jobs himself. In crisis, psychology is survival. The leader's job is to be the thermostat, not the thermometer.

### 03. The 800-Mile Impossible Voyage
When rescue required sailing a 22-foot lifeboat 800 miles through the world's worst seas, Shackleton didn't despair — he planned. Then executed. Then adapted. Then executed again. Break the impossible into possible steps. Then take the first one.

## Weekly Challenge
Identify a situation that feels overwhelming. Write it down. Now list: What's the ONE next action I can control? Take that action. Then identify the next one.
