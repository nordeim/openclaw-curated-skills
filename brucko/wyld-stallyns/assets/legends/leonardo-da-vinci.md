## Lessons

### 01. Curiosità — Relentless Questioning
Leonardo kept notebooks filled with questions: Why is the sky blue? How do birds fly? What happens when you smile? He didn't wait for assignments — he was pulled by wonder. Cultivate questions the way others collect answers.

### 02. Sfumato — Embrace Mystery
The word means "smoke" — the technique of soft, hazy outlines. Leonardo applied this to thinking too: sit with ambiguity, resist premature certainty. The interesting stuff lives in the blur between disciplines, between knowing and not-knowing.

### 03. Connessione — Everything Connects
A river's flow explains the curl of hair. Anatomy informs architecture. Leonardo saw patterns across domains because he studied everything. Your unrelated interests aren't distractions — they're cross-training.

## Weekly Challenge
Start a "curiosity notebook" this week. When something makes you wonder — anything — write the question down. Don't answer it yet. Just collect questions. See what patterns emerge across a week of wondering.

## Reading List
- *Leonardo da Vinci* by Walter Isaacson
- *How to Think Like Leonardo da Vinci* by Michael Gelb

## When to Summon Leonardo
- Stuck in a single discipline's thinking
- Need fresh observation (look again, harder)
- Connecting disparate ideas or fields
- Embracing ambiguity rather than forcing clarity

## The Leonardo Question
**"What do I notice that others miss? What connects to what?"**
