## Lessons

### 01. Attention as Love
For Weil, attention isn't just focus — it's a form of love. When you truly attend to something (a person, a problem, a moment), you give it the gift of your full being. Most of what we call "thinking" is actually just waiting to speak. Real attention is empty, receptive, waiting.

### 02. Decreation
Weil believed we must "decreate" ourselves — get our ego out of the way — to truly see. The self is a distortion lens. When you remove the constant question "what does this mean for ME?", you finally see clearly. Truth requires self-forgetting.

### 03. Gravity and Grace
Most of our actions follow "gravity" — we do what's easy, what feels natural, what serves our comfort. Grace is the force that pulls against gravity — toward truth, beauty, and goodness even when it costs us. Attention is how we access grace.

## Weekly Challenge
Once a day this week, practice pure attention for 5 minutes. Choose anything — a tree, a person, a sound. Don't analyze it. Don't think about what it means to you. Just attend to it completely, as if it were the most important thing in the universe. Notice what shifts.
