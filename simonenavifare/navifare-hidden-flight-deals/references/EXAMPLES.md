## Example 3: Multi-Segment Connection Flight

### Conversation

**User**: Google Flights shows $890 for LAX to Tokyo via Seattle on July 10. Alaska AS338 to Seattle, then ANA NH178 to Tokyo. Should I book it?

**Assistant** (activates skill):
Let me verify that's the best price for your itinerary with the connection in Seattle.

*[Extracts details]*
- Segment 1: AS338, LAX → SEA, July 10
- Segment 2: NH178, SEA → NRT, July 10
- Need departure/arrival times for accurate search

**Question**: What are the departure and arrival times for each segment?
- AS338 LAX → SEA: Departure time?
- NH178 SEA → NRT: Departure time?

**User**: AS338 departs 10 AM arrives 12:30 PM. NH178 departs 2:30 PM arrives 5 PM next day.

**Assistant**:
Perfect! Searching now...

*[Calls search with both segments]*

⚠️ **Prices have changed**

Your reference: $890 on Google Flights
Current best price: **$925 on Kiwi.com**
📈 Increase: $35 (3.9%)

Prices for this route have gone up slightly since you checked.

## Example 4: Round-Trip Validation Before Booking

### Conversation

**User**: I'm about to book this flight to Athens. Can you check if it's a good price first?

**Details:**
- London Gatwick to Athens, June 10-17
- British Airways outbound, Aegean return
- £380 total on Skyscanner

**Assistant** (activates skill):
Absolutely! Let me verify that's the best price before you commit.

I need a few more details for an accurate search:

- Return: Aegean (A3) flight number and departure time?
- Travel class (Economy, Business)?

**User**:
- Outbound: BA632, departs 7:30 AM, arrives 1:15 PM

### Conversation

**User**: Found a flight to Paris for $600. Is that good?

Your reference: €450 on Kayak

**All available prices:**

| # | Website | Price | Fare Type | Booking Link |

All prices checked: 2025-02-11 17:45 UTC

The €450 price you found is the best current rate. I recommend booking it through Kayak or Skyscanner (both offer the same price).

**Note**: Swiss International Air Lines (LX) is a reputable carrier. This is a direct flight with good timing, making it excellent value.

## Example 7: Price Alert - High Demand Route

### Conversation

**User**: Is $1,200 good for Miami to London on December 20? American Airlines.

**Assistant** (activates skill):
Let me check current prices for that route and date.

*[Extracts details, asks for flight number and times]*

**User**: AA38, departs 9:15 PM, arrives 10:30 AM next day.

**Assistant**:
Searching...

⚠️ **Peak season alert**

Your reference: $1,200
Current best price: **$1,150 on Momondo**
💰 Savings: $50 (4.2%)

**Top 3 Options:**

| # | Website | Price | Fare Type | Booking Link |
|---|---------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | Momondo | $1,150 | Standard | [Book Now](https://momondo.com/...) |
| 2 | Kayak | $1,195 | Standard | [Book Now](https://kayak.com/...) |
| 3 | Google Flights | $1,200 | Standard | [Book Now](https://google.com/flights/...) |

All prices checked: 2025-02-11 18:00 UTC

**Important context:**
- December 20 is peak Christmas travel
- Transatlantic flights are in very high demand
- Prices typically increase significantly closer to departure
- $1,150-$1,200 is actually reasonable for this route/date

**Recommendation**: If you need to travel on December 20 specifically, I'd suggest booking the $1,150 Momondo option soon. If you have flexibility, flying a few days earlier (Dec 17-19) or later (Dec 21-23) could save $300-500.

Would you like me to check alternative dates?

## Example 8: Error Handling - No Results

### Conversation

**User**: Can you check if £250 is good for Manchester to Ibiza on June 30? Flight ZZ1234.

**Assistant** (activates skill):
Let me search for that flight.

*[Searches but gets no results]*

❌ **No results found**

Navifare couldn't find current prices for this exact itinerary.

**Possible issues:**
1. **Airline code "ZZ"** is not recognized in our database
2. **Flight number 1234** may be incorrect or the flight may not exist
3. The route may not be currently scheduled for June 30

**Can you help me verify:**
- Which airline operates this flight? (Ryanair, easyJet, Jet2?)
- Are you sure about the flight number ZZ1234?
- Is this a direct flight or with connections?

**Alternative approach:**
If you're flexible on the exact flight, I can search for:
- "Manchester to Ibiza on June 30, Economy, 1 adult"
- And find the best prices across all airlines

Would you like me to do that instead?

**User**: Oh sorry, it's Jet2 flight LS449, not ZZ1234!

**Assistant**:
No problem! Let me search for Jet2 LS449 now.

*[Searches with correct airline/flight]*

✅ **Found better prices!**
... [continues with normal results]
