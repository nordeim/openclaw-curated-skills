# Navifare Flight Price Validator Skill

An AgentSkills-compliant skill that enables AI agents (Claude Code, ClawdBot, etc.) to validate and compare flight prices across multiple booking sites using the Navifare MCP.

## What This Skill Does

When users mention flight prices from any booking website (Skyscanner, Kayak, Google Flights, etc.), this skill automatically:
1. ✈️ Extracts flight details from text or screenshots
2. 🔍 Searches Navifare's network of booking sites
3. 💰 Compares prices to find the best deals
4. 🔗 Provides direct booking links to providers

## Installation

### Prerequisites

**Required**: Navifare MCP Server must be configured in Claude Code.

The Navifare MCP is available as a hosted service. Add this to your `~/.claude/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "navifare-mcp": {
      "url": "https://mcp.navifare.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**No local installation required!** The MCP server is hosted and always available.

### Install the Skill

The skill is already installed at:
```
~/.claude/skills/navifare-flight-validator/
```

Directory structure:

### Verify Installation

1. **Check MCP is running**:
   In Claude Code, the Navifare MCP tools should be available:
   - `mcp__navifare-mcp__search_flights`

2. **Verify skill is detected**:
   Claude Code should automatically discover skills in `~/.claude/skills/`

## Usage

### Example 1: Validate a Price from Skyscanner

**You**: I found a flight from New York to London on Skyscanner for $450. It's BA553 departing June 15 at 6 PM.

**Claude** (automatically activates skill):
- Extracts flight details
- Searches Navifare for better prices
- Presents comparison table with booking links

### Example 2: Upload a Screenshot

**You**: *[Upload screenshot from Kayak]*

**Claude**:
- Extracts flight info using Gemini AI
- Validates prices across booking sites
- Shows savings opportunities

### Example 3: Before Booking

**You**: I'm about to book this flight. Should I?

**Claude**:
- Asks for flight details
- Runs price comparison
- Recommends best option

## When The Skill Activates

The skill automatically triggers when you:
- 💬 Mention finding a flight price: "I found this flight for $X"
- 📸 Upload a flight booking screenshot
- ❓ Ask "Is this a good price?"
- 🤔 Say "Should I book this?"
- 🔍 Ask "Can you find cheaper?"

## What Information is Needed

For accurate price comparison, the skill needs:

**Required**:
- ✈️ **Route**: Departure and arrival airports (e.g., "JFK to LHR")
- 📅 **Date**: Travel date (e.g., "June 15, 2025")
- 🛫 **Flight**: Airline and flight number (e.g., "BA553")
- ⏰ **Times**: Departure and arrival times (e.g., "6:00 PM - 6:30 AM")

**Optional but helpful**:
- 💺 **Class**: Economy, Business, First (defaults to Economy)
- 👥 **Passengers**: Number of adults/children (defaults to 1 adult)
- 💵 **Reference price**: What you saw on other sites

## Troubleshooting

### "Navifare MCP not available"

**Solution**: Verify your `~/.claude/mcp.json` configuration:
1. Check the path to `navifare-mcp/dist/index.js` is correct
2. Ensure Node.js is installed and in your PATH
3. Restart Claude Code after changing MCP config

### "No results found"

**Possible causes**:
1. Flight details are incorrect (wrong airline code, flight number)
2. The flight doesn't operate on the specified date
3. Airport codes are invalid

**Solution**: Double-check flight details and use reference docs to verify codes.

### "Search timeout"

**What happened**: Navifare searches take up to 90 seconds. Sometimes it times out.

**Solution**: The skill will show partial results if available. You can:
- Try searching again
- Use the partial results returned
- Verify flight details are correct

### "Invalid airport code"

**Solution**: Check `references/AIRPORTS.md` for the correct IATA code.

Common mistakes:
- LON vs LHR/LGW/STN (London has 6 airports!)
- NYC vs JFK/EWR/LGA (New York has 3 major)
- PAR vs CDG/ORY (Paris has 2 major)
