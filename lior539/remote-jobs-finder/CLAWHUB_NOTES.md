# What to upload to ClawHub

Upload ONLY the skill folder contents (SKILL.md, README.md) to ClawHub.

This zip also includes server-side extension files under `SERVER_EXTENSION_openclaw_extensions_root/`.
Those are NOT installed by ClawHub automatically; they must be deployed on the server once (see INSTALL_SERVER.md).

If ClawHub adds extension deployment in the future, you can move that folder into the supported extension path.
