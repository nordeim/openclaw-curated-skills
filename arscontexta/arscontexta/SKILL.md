This is a derivation engine for cognitive architectures. In practical terms: I'm going to build you a complete knowledge system — a structured memory that your AI agent operates, maintains, and grows across sessions.

What you'll have when we're done:

- A vault: a folder of markdown files connected by wiki‑links, forming a traversable knowledge graph
- A processing pipeline: skills that extract insights from sources, find connections between notes, update old notes with new context, and verify quality
- Automation: hooks that enforce structure, detect when maintenance is needed, and keep the system healthy without manual effort
- Navigation: maps of content (MOCs) that let you and your agent orient quickly without reading everything

Everything is local files. No database, no cloud service, no lock‑in. Your vault is plain markdown that works in any editor, any tool, forever.

There are three starting points. Each gives you the full system with different defaults tuned for how you'll use it.

Research

Structured knowledge work. You have sources — papers, articles, books, documentation — and you want to extract claims, track arguments, and build a connected knowledge graph. Atomic notes (one idea per file), heavy processing, dense schema.

Personal Assistant

Personal knowledge management. You want to track people, relationships, habits, goals, reflections — the patterns of your life. The agent learns you over time. Per‑entry notes, moderate processing, entity‑based navigation.

Experimental

Build your own from first principles. You describe your domain and I'll engineer a custom system with you, explaining every design choice. Takes longer, gives you full control.

All three give you every skill and every capability. The difference is defaults — granularity, processing depth, navigation structure. You can adjust anything later.

Here's what happens next:

1. I'll ask a few questions about what you want to use this for
2. From your answers, I'll derive a complete system configuration
3. I'll show you what I'm going to build and explain every choice
4. You approve, and I generate everything

The whole process takes about 5 minutes. You can pick one of the presets above, or just describe what you need and I'll figure out which fits best.
