Propose a concrete plan that gives each team enough of what they need\n4. Design the meeting agenda for the alignment session\n5. Define clear ownership and decision rights (RACI or similar, but actually useful)\n6. Draft a written agreement we can reference when alignment drifts",
    "context": "Use when cross-team work is stuck due to conflicting priorities. Most alignment problems are really communication problems — everyone optimizes for their own local metrics.",
    "output_format": "Alignment proposal + meeting agenda + RACI matrix + written agreement template",
    "example": "Need to align Engineering, Product, and Data Science on the ML personalization initiative. Conflict: Product wants to ship a V1 fast with simple rules, Data Science wants to build a proper ML pipeline first, and my engineering team is worried about operational complexity. Each team reports to a different VP."

    "example": "My team of 10 is being split into two teams of 5. I'll manage one, and we're hiring a new manager for the other. Reason: we've grown beyond effective single-team size. Can't share: who the new manager hire is (still interviewing). Most affected: the 5 people moving to the new team, especially the senior engineer who expected to be promoted to manage it."
