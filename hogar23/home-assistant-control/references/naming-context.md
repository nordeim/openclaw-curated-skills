# Home Assistant Naming Context

Use this file to keep stable, user-specific naming mappings so commands like
"turn on living room light" resolve reliably.

## How to use

1. Run `./scripts/save_naming_context.sh` to refresh auto-detected candidates.
2. Keep `## Manual aliases` as the source of truth for your preferred names.
3. Add multiple aliases for the same entity if needed.

## Manual aliases (authoritative)

- living room light => light.example_living_room_main
- office light => switch.example_office_light
- bedroom main light => switch.example_bedroom_main_light
