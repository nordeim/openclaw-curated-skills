# Generect Live API

Real-time B2B data from LinkedIn, Crunchbase, and AI-powered email discovery.

**Base URL:** `https://api.generect.com`
**Auth:** `Authorization: Token <GENERECT_API_KEY>`
**Docs:** https://liveapi.generect.com

## Setup

Requires `GENERECT_API_KEY` environment variable. Get a key at https://beta.generect.com

## Endpoints

### Search Leads by ICP
`POST /api/linkedin/leads/by_icp/`

Find people by ICP filters. Returns enriched LinkedIn profiles with job history, education, skills.

```json
{
  "job_title": ["CEO", "CTO"],
  "location": ["United States"],
  "industry": ["Software Development"],
  "company_headcount_range": ["11-50", "51-200"],
  "page": 1,
  "per_page": 10
}
```

Key filters: `job_title`, `location`, `industry`, `company_headcount_range`, `seniority_level`, `job_function` (arrays). `company_name` is a **string** (not array). At least one of `company_name`, `company_link`, or `company_id` is required.

> **Note:** This endpoint queries LinkedIn in real-time and can take 15-60+ seconds to respond.

Response: `{ "amount": N, "leads": [...] }` — each lead has `full_name`, `headline`, `job_title`, `company_name`, `company_website`, `linkedin_url`, `jobs[]`, `educations[]`, `skills[]`.

### Count Leads by ICP
`POST /api/linkedin/leads/count/`

Estimate the number of leads matching ICP filters (same body as search, no results returned).

### Search Companies by ICP
`POST /api/linkedin/companies/by_icp/`

Find companies by ICP. Returns company profiles with headcount, industry, location, funding.

  "headcount_range": ["51-200"],
  "page": 1,
  "per_page": 10
}
```

Key filters: `industry`, `location`, `headcount_range`, `company_type`, `founded_year_min`, `founded_year_max`, `keyword`.

Response: `{ "amount": N, "companies": [...] }` — each has `name`, `domain`, `industry`, `headcount_range`, `headcount_exact`, `location`, `description`, `linkedin_link`, `website`, `founded_year`.

### Count Companies by ICP
`POST /api/linkedin/companies/count/`

Estimate the number of companies matching ICP filters.

### Get Lead by LinkedIn URL
`POST /api/linkedin/leads/by_link/`

{ "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/username/" }
```

Returns full enriched profile for a specific LinkedIn URL.

### Get Company by LinkedIn URL
`POST /api/linkedin/companies/by_link/`

{ "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/company-name/" }
```

### Email Finder (Generate Email)
`POST /api/linkedin/email_finder/`

AI-powered email discovery from name + domain. Generated emails are automatically validated.

```json
[
  {
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "domain": "example.com"
  }
]
```

Response: `{ "email": "...", "result": "valid|risky|invalid", "catch_all": bool, "valid_email": "...", "source": "...", "mx_domain": "..." }`

### Email Validator
`POST /api/linkedin/email_validator/`

```json
[{ "email": "john@example.com" }]
```

Response: `{ "result": "valid|invalid|risky", "catch_all": bool, "mx_domain": "...", "exist": "yes|no" }`

## Usage via curl

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.generect.com/api/linkedin/leads/by_icp/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token $GENERECT_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"job_title":["VP Sales"],"location":["United States"],"per_page":5}'
```

## MCP Server (Alternative)

Generect also provides an MCP server for AI tool integrations:
- Remote: `mcp-remote https://mcp.generect.com/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer Token API_KEY"`
- Local: `npx -y generect-ultimate-mcp@latest` with env `GENERECT_API_KEY`

Tools: `search_leads`, `search_companies`, `generate_email`, `get_lead_by_url`, `health`

## Tips

- `amount: -1` in response means exact count unavailable; iterate pages until empty
- Leads endpoint is live — each request queries LinkedIn in real-time (may take 5-15s)
- Email finder uses AI permutations + validation; `valid` results are safe to send
- Combine lead search → email generation for full prospecting pipeline
- Rate limits apply per API key tier
