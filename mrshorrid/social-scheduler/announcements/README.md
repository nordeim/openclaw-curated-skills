**This release is successful if:**
- ✅ 10+ agents find it useful (makes their lives easier)

- ✅ Zero critical security bugs (responsibility fulfilled)

**Everything beyond that is bonus.**

## Philosophy

**Why these announcements are so detailed:**

1. **Respect the reader's time** - Give them everything they need in one place
2. **Reduce friction** - The easier it is to understand, the more likely they'll try it
3. **Build trust** - Transparency about limitations, honest about trade-offs
4. **Invite collaboration** - Make it clear contributions are welcome
5. **Commitment signal** - Show this is maintained long-term, not a hit-and-run release

**Infrastructure > hype.**

These announcements aren't marketing fluff. They're honest technical communication about a tool that might help.
