## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Connection refused | Ravenclaw not running | Start Ravenclaw: `python ravenclaw.py` |
| Domain not allowed | Recipient domain not in filter | Update `DOMAIN_FILTER` in .env |
| target_time must be in future | Scheduled time passed | Use future timestamp |
| SMTP failed | Email server error | Check .env credentials |

---

## Troubleshooting

**Ravenclaw not responding:**
```bash
# Check if running
curl http://localhost:5002/health

# Start Ravenclaw
cd path/to/ravenclaw
python ravenclaw.py
```

**Emails not sending:**
- Verify SMTP credentials in `.env`
- Check domain is in `DOMAIN_FILTER`
- Review `ravenclaw.log`

**Scheduled emails not sent:**
- Ravenclaw must be running for scheduled sending
- Check `/schedule/list` for status
- Ensure `target_time` is in ISO-8601 format
