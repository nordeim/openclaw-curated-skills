Use this checklist before drafting any RFC.

1. Problem definition
- What is broken, missing, or risky today?
- What measurable signal proves the problem exists?

2. Stakeholders
- Who decides?
- Who implements?
- Who is operationally affected?

3. Constraints
- Technical constraints
- Organizational/process constraints
- Legal/regulatory constraints
- Budget/time constraints

4. Alternatives considered
- Which alternatives were considered?
- Why not choose each alternative?

5. Risks and open questions
- Top risks if proposal is approved
- Top risks if proposal is rejected
- Unknowns requiring follow-up

Do not produce a final RFC if one of these sections is missing.
