## Pre-Publish Checklist

### Required Updates

#### 1. Metadata sanity check
`SKILL.md` frontmatter already exists. Verify before publish:
- `version` matches `CHANGELOG.md`
- `author` is set as desired
- tags/description still reflect scope

#### 2. Packaging safety check
`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `.clawhubignore` are now present.

#### 3. Verify code quality
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] All imports resolved
- [ ] Examples in `examples/` work
- [ ] Tests documented in `tests/`

### Files Check
```bash
Required:
- SKILL.md (with YAML frontmatter)

Recommended:
- README.md
- examples/README.md
- examples/content-pipeline.json
- examples/task-router.json
```

## Publishing Steps

### Step 1: Validate Locally
```bash
# Navigate to skill parent directory
cd skills

# Try validation (may require clawhub CLI setup)
claw skill validate ./agent-orchestrator
```

### Step 2: Login to ClawHub
```bash
# Browser-based authentication
clawhub login

# Or with token (if you have one)
clawhub login --token YOUR_TOKEN
```

### Step 3: Publish
```bash
clawhub publish ./agent-orchestrator \
  --slug agent-orchestrator \
  --name "Agent Orchestrator" \
  --version 1.0.0 \
  --changelog "Initial release: 5 multi-agent patterns implemented" \
  --tags "multi-agent,orchestration,automation,productivity"
```

### Step 4: Verify Publication

# Check skill is live
clawhub inspect agent-orchestrator

# List your published skills
clawhub list
```

## Monetization Plan

### Current State
ClawHub has **no built-in payment system**. Skills are free, public, and open.

### Recommended Strategy: Gateway to Premium

#### Phase 1: Build Authority (Now - 3 months)
1. **Publish free skill** to establish presence
2. **Add GitHub link** in SKILL.md for visibility
3. **Document complex workflows** to showcase expertise
4. **Monitor usage** for enterprise interest

**Revenue:** $0 (building reputation)

#### Phase 2: Optional Commercial Layer (3-6 months)
If there's sufficient user interest:
1. Keep core skill open and local-first
2. Offer optional consulting/support around implementation
3. If a hosted layer is ever introduced, document trust boundaries and data flow explicitly before rollout

**Pricing options (service layer, not required for core skill):**
- Free: Local execution
- Pro Services: setup/optimization support
- Enterprise: custom workflows, SLA, training

#### Phase 3: Enterprise Consulting (Ongoing)
1. Add to SKILL.md:
   ```markdown
   ## Enterprise Support
   Need custom multi-agent workflows for your team?
   Contact: your@email.com
   Services: Implementation, customization, training, SLA support
   ```

**Typical engagements:**
- Custom pattern development: $2,000-5,000
- Enterprise support contracts: $500-2,000/month
- Team training sessions: $1,500-3,000

### Alternative Revenue Streams

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- **Code quality:** Tested thoroughly in development
- **Security:** No network calls (uses sessions_spawn only)
- **Maintenance:** Pure Python, minimal dependencies

### Medium Risk
- **Discoverability:** Need marketing to stand out in 3,000+ skills
- **Adoption:** Multi-agent is advanced feature; may need education

### Mitigation
- Strong documentation with examples
- Community engagement and tutorials
- Clear value proposition in description
