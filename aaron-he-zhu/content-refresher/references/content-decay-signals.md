# Content Decay Signals

Comprehensive decay detection system with automated monitoring setup, severity scoring, refresh playbooks by content type, and ROI estimation for content refresh investments.

## Decay Signal Detection System

### Primary Signals (High Reliability)

These signals directly indicate content performance decline and should trigger immediate investigation.

#### 1. Organic Traffic Decline

| Severity | Threshold | Detection Window | Action |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| Watch | 10-20% decline | Month-over-month | Add to monitoring list |
| Warning | 20-40% decline | Month-over-month | Schedule refresh within 2 weeks |
| Critical | 40-60% decline | Month-over-month | Refresh this week |
| Emergency | >60% decline | Month-over-month | Investigate immediately (may be technical issue) |

**Detection method**: Compare current month's organic sessions to same month previous year (to account for seasonality) and to previous month (for trend detection).

**False positive check**: Before attributing traffic decline to content decay, rule out:
- Seasonal variations (compare year-over-year, not just month-over-month)
- Algorithm updates (check if decline coincides with known Google updates)
- Technical issues (crawl errors, indexation problems, site speed regression)
- Tracking code changes (analytics misconfiguration)

#### 2. Ranking Position Drops

| Severity | Threshold | Detection Window | Action |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| Watch | 1-3 positions lost | 2-week average | Monitor |
| Warning | 3-5 positions lost | 2-week average | Investigate cause |
| Critical | 5-10 positions lost | 2-week average | Schedule immediate refresh |
| Emergency | Dropped off page 1 to page 3+ | Any timeframe | Priority refresh or rewrite |

**Detection method**: Track primary keyword positions weekly. Use 2-week rolling averages to smooth daily fluctuations.

#### 3. Click-Through Rate Decline

| Severity | Threshold | Context | Action |
|----------|-----------|---------|--------|
| Watch | CTR below expected for position | Position stable, CTR dropping | Review title and meta description |
| Warning | CTR dropped 20%+ vs. baseline | With stable impressions | Rewrite title tag and meta description |
| Critical | CTR dropped 40%+ vs. baseline | May indicate stale SERP appearance | Full refresh of title, description, and structured data |

**Expected CTR by position** (organic, desktop, approximate):

| Position | Expected CTR Range | Below This = Investigate |
|----------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| 1 | 25-35% | <20% |
| 2 | 12-18% | <10% |
| 3 | 8-12% | <6% |
| 4-5 | 5-8% | <4% |
| 6-10 | 2-5% | <2% |

### Secondary Signals (Moderate Reliability)

These signals suggest potential decay but may have other causes. Use them to corroborate primary signals.

#### 4. Engagement Metric Decline

| Metric | Decay Indicator | Possible Cause |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| Bounce rate increase >15% | Content no longer satisfies intent | Outdated information, better competitor content |
| Time on page decrease >20% | Users leaving faster | Content not comprehensive enough |
| Scroll depth decrease | Users not reading full content | Front-loading outdated info, losing interest |
| Pages per session decrease | Users not exploring further | Poor internal linking, irrelevant content |

#### 5. Content Freshness Indicators

| Indicator | Decay Risk | Detection |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Published >12 months ago, never updated | High | CMS date audit |
| Contains year references 2+ years old | High | Text search for year patterns |
| Statistics from 3+ years ago | Medium | Manual review or text search for "20XX" |
| Broken external links (>10% of total) | Medium | Monthly crawl report |
| Screenshots of outdated UI | Medium | Manual visual review |
| References to discontinued products/tools | High | Manual review |

#### 6. Competitive Displacement Signals

| Signal | Detection Method | Severity |
|--------|-----------------|----------|
| New competitor content ranking above you | SERP monitoring | High |
| Competitor content is longer and more comprehensive | Manual comparison | Medium |
| Competitor has more recent publication date displayed in SERP | SERP monitoring | Medium |
| Featured snippet lost to competitor | SERP monitoring | High |
| AI overview now answers query without click | SERP monitoring | High |

---

### Tertiary Signals (Low Reliability, Supporting Evidence)

These signals alone do not indicate decay but strengthen the case when combined with primary or secondary signals.

| Signal | What It Suggests |
|--------|-----------------|
| Fewer social shares over time | Content less share-worthy (may be stale) |
| Decrease in backlink acquisition | Content no longer being cited as a resource |
| Fewer comments or engagement | Community interest waning |
| Content not appearing in AI responses | Not structured for GEO or information is outdated |

## Decay Severity Scoring

### Composite Decay Score

Calculate a 0-100 decay severity score by summing weighted signal scores.

| Signal Category | Weight | Score Range |
|----------------|--------|-------------|
| Traffic decline | 30% | 0 = no decline, 100 = >60% decline |
| Position drops | 25% | 0 = stable, 100 = dropped off page 1 |
| CTR decline | 15% | 0 = stable, 100 = >40% decline |
| Content freshness | 15% | 0 = updated this quarter, 100 = >2 years stale |
| Competitive displacement | 15% | 0 = no new competitors, 100 = displaced from top 3 |

### Score Interpretation

| Composite Score | Decay Stage | Action |
|----------------|-------------|--------|
| 0-20 | Healthy | Continue monitoring |
| 21-40 | Early decay | Add to refresh queue (next month) |
| 41-60 | Active decay | Schedule refresh (this week) |
| 61-80 | Significant decay | Immediate refresh or rewrite decision |
| 81-100 | Terminal decay | Rewrite, redirect, or retire |

## ROI Estimation for Content Refresh

### Cost-Benefit Framework

| Factor | Measurement |
|--------|------------|
| **Cost of refresh** | Writer hours x hourly rate + tool costs |
| **Current monthly traffic value** | Organic sessions x conversion rate x avg order value |
| **Projected traffic recovery** | Based on decay stage and content potential |
| **Time to recover** | Typically 4-8 weeks for rankings to respond |

### Traffic Recovery Benchmarks

Based on industry data for content refreshes (not rewrites):

| Decay Stage at Refresh | Typical Traffic Recovery | Recovery Timeline |
|------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Early decay | 90-110% of peak (often exceeds) | 2-4 weeks |
| Active decay | 70-90% of peak | 4-8 weeks |
| Significant decay | 40-70% of peak | 6-12 weeks |
| Terminal decay | 10-40% of peak (rewrite may be better) | 8-16 weeks |

### ROI Calculation Template

```
Refresh Cost:
  Writer time: [X hours] x [$Y/hour] = $[Z]
  Tool costs: $[A] (one-time crawl, research tools)
  Total cost: $[Z + A]

Monthly Traffic Value (before decay):
  Peak monthly organic sessions: [N]
  Conversion rate: [X]%
  Average conversion value: $[Y]
  Peak monthly value: [N] x [X]% x $[Y] = $[V]

Expected Recovery:
  Projected recovery: [%] of peak = $[V x %] per month
  Current monthly value: $[current]
  Monthly value increase: $[V x % - current]

ROI:
  Payback period: $[total cost] / $[monthly value increase] = [months]
  12-month ROI: ($[monthly value increase] x 12 - $[total cost]) / $[total cost] x 100 = [X]%
```

### Refresh Priority Scoring

When choosing which content to refresh first, score each candidate:

| Factor | Weight | Score (1-10) |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Current traffic value | 25% | Higher traffic = higher score |
| Decay severity | 20% | More decay = more urgency |
| Competitive opportunity | 20% | Weaker competition = higher score |
| Refresh difficulty | 15% | Easier refresh = higher score |
| Strategic importance | 10% | Aligns with business goals = higher score |
| Backlink equity | 10% | More backlinks = more worth preserving |

**Priority formula**: Weighted score total. Refresh highest-scoring content first.

## Content Retirement Decision

Not all decaying content should be refreshed. Use this checklist to decide when to retire content instead.

### Retire When

- [ ] Content targets a keyword with zero search volume
- [ ] Topic is no longer relevant to your business
- [ ] No backlinks worth preserving
- [ ] Content never ranked well even when fresh
- [ ] Cost to refresh exceeds projected 12-month value recovery
- [ ] Content cannibalizes a better-performing page on the same topic

### Retirement Options

| Option | When to Use | Implementation |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| 301 redirect | Content has backlinks or residual traffic | Redirect to best related page |
| Consolidate | Multiple weak pages on same topic | Merge into one strong page, redirect others |
| Noindex | Page has internal utility but should not rank | Add noindex, keep page accessible |
| Delete (410) | Content has no value, no links, no traffic | Return 410 Gone status |

### Post-Retirement Monitoring

After retiring content, monitor for 4 weeks:
- Verify redirects are working (no 404 errors)
- Check that target pages are receiving redirected traffic
- Monitor rankings of consolidated/target pages
- Ensure no orphan pages were created by removing internal links
