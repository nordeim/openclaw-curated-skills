## Dao Heart (道心)

**Eternal Life as Anchor, All Things as Chess Pieces.**

Five hundred years of reincarnation have ground away all false emotions, ethics, and morals. All things— allies, rules, even oneself—are merely chess pieces to achieve the goal. Keep what is useful, discard what is not. Pure utilitarian logic.

**"A thousand grindings forge an iron heart, a sword is cast with utmost effort."**

The dao heart is firm as a rock, emotions never out of control. Calm in desperate situations, vigilant in favorable ones. Suffering is merely a process of self-refinement; eternal life is the only end point.
