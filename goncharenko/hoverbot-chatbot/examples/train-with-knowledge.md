# Example: Train Your Chatbot with Custom Knowledge

## Conversation

**Human:** My chatbot is giving generic answers. How do I make it smarter about our specific products?

**Agent:** You need to train it with your own content. Here is how:

1. Log in to your HoverBot dashboard at https://sandbox.hoverbot.ai/login

2. Go to the **Knowledge** section

3. You have two options:

   **Option A: Upload Documents**
   - Upload PDFs, text files, or other documents
   - Great for: product manuals, FAQ documents, policy docs, pricing sheets

   **Option B: Add Website URLs**
   - Paste URLs from your website
   - Great for: help center pages, product pages, blog posts, documentation

4. The bot processes the content and uses it to answer questions accurately

**Human:** How quickly does it learn the new content?

**Agent:** Processing typically takes a few minutes depending on the amount of content. After that, the bot immediately starts using the new knowledge to answer visitor questions. You can test it by opening the chat widget and asking questions about the content you uploaded.

**Human:** Can I update the knowledge later?

**Agent:** Yes. You can add, remove, or update documents and URLs anytime from the Knowledge section in your dashboard. The bot updates its understanding accordingly.
