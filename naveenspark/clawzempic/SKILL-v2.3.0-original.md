# Clawzempic

**Up to 95% cheaper. No quality loss. Don't get ripped off by LLM providers!**

59-prompt A/B evaluation, blind-scored by GPT-4o:

```
Quality:  4.53 (Clawzempic) vs 4.52 (direct Opus) — statistically tied!
Cost:     up to 95% cheaper
Win rate: 28-28-3 (dead even)
```

Get Clawzempic and build the OpenClaw bot of your dreams: smart routing, prompt caching, zero-config God-Tier memory, and security shield that keeps your credentials safe. All in one install that takes 30 seconds!

Works with **OpenRouter** (300+ models), **OpenAI**, and **Anthropic** keys.

```
OpenClaw → Clawzempic proxy → Your LLM Provider (OpenRouter, OpenAI, or Anthropic)
           ├─ Routes simple tasks to cheaper models (saves up to 95%)
           ├─ Caches repeated context (prompt caching breakpoints)
           ├─ Injects memory across sessions (5-tier, zero config)
           └─ Blocks credential leaks + injection attacks
```

## Install

### OpenClaw Plugin (recommended)

```bash
openclaw plugins install clawzempic
openclaw models auth login --provider clawzempic
```

The auth flow creates your account, stores your provider key server-side (encrypted with AES256), registers 4 models, and sets `clawzempic/auto` as default. Start saving $$$ in 30 seconds.

### Standalone CLI

```bash
npx clawzempic
```

## How Routing Works

Every request is scored for complexity in <2ms (no LLM in the hot path) and routed to the right model.

**Clawzempic works with any model on OpenRouter (300+ models across all providers), plus direct Anthropic and OpenAI keys.** You pick your provider — Clawzempic routes within it.

| Tier | Traffic | What Happens | Savings |
|------|---------|--------------|---------|
| **Simple** | ~45% | Routes to cheapest capable model | up to 95% |
| **Mid** | ~25% | Routes to mid-tier model | up to 80% |
| **Complex** | ~20% | Routes to top-tier model | 0% (full quality) |
| **Reasoning** | ~10% | Top-tier + extended thinking | 0% |

*Example with OpenRouter: Simple → GPT-4o-mini ($0.15/M), Mid → Gemini Flash ($0.60/M), Complex → Claude Opus ($15/M). Works with any OpenRouter model — DeepSeek, Llama, Mistral, and hundreds more. Also supports direct Anthropic and OpenAI keys.*

Classification uses a weighted multi-dimension scorer — vocabulary complexity, structural depth, domain signals, reasoning markers. Chain depth (3+ tool results) auto-escalates to complex. No LLM classifier in the hot path.

## Zero-Config Memory

Most memory solutions are instructions that tell your agent to write to files. If the agent skips a step or compacts before flushing, your memory is gone.

Clawzempic handles memory **server-side**. Your agent doesn't need to "remember" to remember. No plugins, no API keys, no OPENAI_API_KEY for embeddings, no setup.

```

**vs. memory-only skills:** No OPENAI_API_KEY required. No plugins to install. No WAL protocol to hope your agent follows. Server-side extraction and retrieval means it works every time, not just when the agent remembers to write to a file.

## Security Shield

7-component system. No other routing or memory tool offers this.

- **Credential detection** — catches API keys (`sk-or-*`, `sk-*`, `gsk_*`), tokens, and passwords in tool output before they reach the model
- **Injection detection** — blocks prompt injection attempts embedded in tool results
- **Tool output inspection** — prevents data exfiltration via tool calls
- **Policy engine** — configurable rules per client (coming soon: self-serve)
- **Audit trail** — every security event logged

Example: your agent calls a tool that returns a `.env` file containing `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`. Clawzempic detects the credential, redacts it, and logs the event before the model ever sees it.

## Available Models

| Model | ID | Use Case |
|-------|-----|----------|
| Auto (recommended) | `clawzempic/auto` | Routes to optimal tier per request |

With an OpenRouter key, you get access to 300+ models across every major provider. Also works with OpenAI and Anthropic keys.

## How It Compares

| | Clawzempic | Router-only tools (ClawRouter, RelayPlane) | Memory-only skills (Elite, Triple Memory) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Quality proof | 59-prompt A/B, blind-scored | No benchmarks | N/A |
| Smart routing | Server-side, <2ms, weighted scorer | Local proxy or rules-based | No |
| Prompt caching | Automatic breakpoints | No | No |
| Memory | 5-tier, zero config, server-side | No | Requires plugins + OPENAI_API_KEY + agent discipline |
| Security | 113/113 red team | No | No |
| Setup | 1 command | Install + configure + run daemon | Multiple skills + config + API keys |
