# Proven Short-Form Video Formats for B2C App Marketing

## Format 1: Couples Doodle (Lovelee)

**What:** Two phones side by side. One person draws/writes on their screen → it appears on partner's screen in real time.

**Specs:**
- Length: 10 seconds
- Orientation: Vertical (9:16)
- Audio: Trending romantic/cute sounds
- Caption style: "POV: [relatable couples scenario]"

**Proven results (Jack's content):**
- 109K likes on "pov: reminding your bf who he belongs to 💖"
- 5.2M likes on "may this type of love & care find you 💕"
- 770K likes on "pov: asking ur bf for a taco date night using this widget"

**Why it works:**
- Visual satisfaction of real-time sync
- Emotional trigger (love, care, belonging)
- Low barrier — anyone in a relationship relates
- "What app is this?" drives organic discovery
- Comments asking for app name = free marketing

**Caption templates:**
- "pov: [action] for your [bf/gf/partner] 💕"
- "may this type of [emotion] find you 🥹"
- "when your partner [does sweet thing] using this app"
- "stop scrolling if you love your [bf/gf] 💖"
- "this app lets you [feature] with your partner"
- "long distance couples need this app 🥺"
- "showing my [bf/gf] how much I love them through doodles"

**Variations:**
- Different messages: "good morning," names, hearts, inside jokes
- Different times of day (morning routine, bedtime)
- Different phone cases/aesthetics
- Holiday themes (Valentine's, anniversaries)

## Format 2: AI Slideshows (Larry Method)

**What:** AI-generated images in slideshow format with text overlays and trending audio.

**Specs:**
- Length: 5-15 seconds (3-5 slides)
- Generated via AI image tools + programmatic text overlay
- Trending audio from TikTok

**Key elements:**
- First slide = hook (bold text, surprising visual)
- Each slide builds curiosity or delivers value
- Final slide = CTA or reveal
- Text overlays added programmatically

**Best for:** Apps where screenshots or lifestyle imagery tells the story

## Format 3: "Found the cutest app" UGC-style

**What:** Person shows app on screen with excited narration or text overlay.

**Example:** @lovewithmeoww — "Found the cutest app for LDR couples" (4.7K likes, 1.2K saves)

**Why it works:**
- Feels like genuine discovery, not an ad
- "App??" comments drive algorithm
- Relatable, aspirational

## Format 4: Before/After or Transformation

**What:** Show a problem → show the app solving it.

**Best for:** Utility apps, design apps, photo editing

## General Principles

1. **Hook in first 1 second** — text overlay or surprising visual
2. **10 seconds or less** — completion rate is everything for algorithm
3. **Trending audio** — ride the wave of what's hot
4. **Post volume** — 3-6 per day minimum to test formats
5. **Stagger posting times** — morning, afternoon, evening
6. **Cross-post everywhere** — same content to IG, TikTok, YouTube Shorts
7. **Track what works** — views, saves, comments, download spikes
8. **Double down on winners** — remake variations of top performers
9. **Captions matter** — emotional hooks outperform descriptive ones
10. **Comments = gold** — "what app is this?" means the content is working
