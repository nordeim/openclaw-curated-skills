# Graduation & planning rules (editable)

## Default graduation requirements (user may override)
- Compulsory: 17 credits
- Electives: 13 credits
- Online learning: 2 online courses required
- Grades 9–11: must take 8 courses each year (if this is the school rule)

> Note: School boards vary on online opt-out, timetable model, cross-grade enrolment, and what counts as “online”. If the user provides updates, treat the user as source of truth and record the change.

## Workload/strategy constraints (from the original prompt)
- Under graduation + school rules + admissions constraints:
  - Reduce workload pressure each year, especially Grades 11 & 12
  - Prefer shifting difficulty earlier (Grades 9 & 10)
  - Avoid Grade 12 “overload for extra programs” (e.g., very heavy course stacking)
  - For non-required / non-admissions-critical courses, prefer options that are typically easier to score well in
