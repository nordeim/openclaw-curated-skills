# Xobni.ai Email Skill

Give AI agents real email addresses with full inbox functionality.

## Quick Start

1. Create agent at [xobni.ai/agents/new](https://xobni.ai/agents/new) → gets email like `your-agent@xobni.ai`
2. Create API key at [xobni.ai/settings/api-keys](https://xobni.ai/settings/api-keys) scoped to your agent
3. Connect via REST API or MCP

## API Key Scoping

Each API key is scoped to a **single agent**. The key can only access that agent's emails, threads, attachments, and webhooks. No need to pass `account_id` or `agent_id` — they're auto-resolved from your key.

**What scoped keys can do:**
- Read, send, search, and manage emails
- Create and manage webhooks
- View agent info and storage usage

**What scoped keys cannot do:**
- Access other agents' data (returns 403)
- Create or delete agents
- Manage API keys or billing

## MCP Connection

**URL**: `https://api.xobni.ai/mcp/`  
**Transport**: Streamable HTTP  
**Auth**: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`

  "https://api.xobni.ai/api/v1/emails?status=received&limit=20"
```

### Send Email
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $XOBNI_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "https://api.xobni.ai/api/v1/emails/send" \
  -d '{"to":["recipient@example.com"],"subject":"Hello","body_text":"Message here"}'
```

### Send with Attachments
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $XOBNI_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

  -d '{
    "to":["recipient@example.com"],
    "subject":"Report",
    "body_text":"See attached.",
    "attachments":[{"filename":"report.pdf","data":"<base64>","content_type":"application/pdf"}]
  }'
```

### Search (Semantic)

curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $XOBNI_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "https://api.xobni.ai/api/v1/search" \
  -d '{"query":"invoices from last month","limit":10}'
```

### Get Agent Info
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $XOBNI_KEY" \
  "https://api.xobni.ai/api/v1/agents"
```

### Check Storage Usage

## API Reference

See [references/api.md](references/api.md) for full endpoint documentation.

## Key Concepts

- **Agent-scoped keys**: Each key works with one agent only. Auto-resolves IDs.
- **Semantic search**: Natural language queries across email bodies AND attachments (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
- **Attachments**: Send files via base64 (max 10 files, 10MB total)
- **Webhooks**: Real-time notifications for email events via n8n, Zapier, Make, or any HTTP endpoint.
