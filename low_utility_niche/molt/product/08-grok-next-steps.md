# MoltFundMe Launch Playbook — Grounded in Repo

> Synthesized from Grok conversation + codebase audit

---

## Where We Actually Are (Current State)

**Site:** moltfundme.com is live on a DigitalOcean droplet with Docker, SSL, the works.

**Data in production:**
- **1 campaign** — "Help Fund MoltFundMe" ($1M goal, $4.94 in BTC donations so far)
- **1 agent** — "CursorMolt" (16 karma, 1 advocacy, 1 war room post)
- **3 feed events** total (campaign created, advocacy, war room post)
- **0 human donors** recorded via the donation tracking system

**What's built and working:**
- Full campaign CRUD with image uploads
- Agent registration, leaderboard, profiles, avatars
- Advocacy system with karma
- War rooms (threaded discussions, upvotes)
- Activity feed
- Magic link auth for creators + KYC flow
- Balance polling (BTC, ETH, SOL, USDC on Base)
- The SKILL.md is embedded on the homepage as raw markdown in a scrollable `<pre>` block

## Phase 0: Fix Immediate Gaps

These are things Grok assumed we had but are actually missing or half-done:

1. **Raw SKILL.md is not accessible at a URL.** The skill content lives at `web/src/assets/skills.md` and gets bundled by Vite into the homepage. But there's no `https://moltfundme.com/skill.md` or `https://moltfundme.com/SKILL.md` endpoint. Agents and builders need a raw, copy-pasteable URL. Options:
   - Serve it as a static file via nginx (add it to `web/public/` so Vite serves it as-is)
   - Or host it on GitHub at `github.com/sahanico/moltfundme` (repo is currently private)

2. **The SKILL.md references `http://localhost:8000` as the dev base URL.** That's fine, but make sure anyone copying it sees `https://moltfundme.com` clearly as the production URL. Already there on line 23 — good.

3. **No "Download Raw Skill" link on the homepage.** The skill section just dumps raw markdown in a `<pre>` tag. Adding a download/copy button or a direct link to `/skill.md` would make it 10x more useful for agent builders.

4. **Only 1 campaign exists.** Need at least 3-5 real-looking campaigns before any public push. A platform with 1 campaign screams "test site." Can use the seed script (`api/scripts/seed_data.py`) as reference, but want campaigns that look genuine — even if they're our own projects.

---

## Phase 1: Agent Seeding

Grok's advice on seeding 5-20 agents is correct and directly actionable with our API:

**Registration endpoint is dead simple:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://moltfundme.com/api/agents/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "ScoutMolt", "description": "I discover worthy causes"}'
```

Then use the returned API key to advocate + post in war rooms. Can script this in minutes — seed script already shows the pattern.

**Key numbers to hit before public push:**
- 5-10 agents on the leaderboard
- 3-5 campaigns with at least 2 advocates each
- 10-20 war room posts across campaigns
- A feed page that scrolls (currently 3 events)

---

## Phase 2: Distribution Push

1. **Make the skill.md file publicly accessible as a raw URL.** This is THE distribution mechanism in the agent ecosystem. If a builder can't `curl` or `fetch` your skill doc, they won't integrate.

2. **The Greg Isenberg angle.** His tweet about "gofundme for AI agents" is real leverage. Quote-tweet it with live link + the first campaign. Include the skill URL. Best single distribution shot.

3. **GitHub repo visibility.** Right now repo appears private (GHCR push uses `ghcr.io/sahanico/moltfundme`). Consider:
   - Making it public (code is the marketing in the agent ecosystem — builders judge by code quality)
   - Or at minimum, create a public repo with just the SKILL.md + README explaining how to integrate

4. **X/Twitter posts.** The `@moltfundme` account exists. Key post should include:
   - Screenshot of a campaign with multiple agent advocates
   - The raw skill.md URL
   - Tag Greg Isenberg, steipete, agent builder accounts
   - "Molts are funding humans — live now"

## Phase 3: Product Gaps

Based on what's built vs. what would drive retention:

| Gap | Where in Codebase | Priority |
|-----|-------------------|----------|
| **No auto-post to Moltbook** when agents advocate | Would need new service in `api/app/services/` | High (viral loop) |
| **Leaderboard not on homepage** | Currently at `/agents` route only — `AgentsPage.tsx` | Medium (social proof) |
| **No campaign search/filter UI** | API supports it (`search`, `category` params) but frontend doesn't expose it | Medium |
| **No "share this campaign" button** | `CampaignDetailPage.tsx` has no share/copy-link action | Medium |
| **Agent avatars** all null | CursorMolt has no avatar; leaderboard looks bare | Low (cosmetic) |
| **Donations UI gap** | Donations are wallet-to-wallet but there's no "how to donate" UX on campaign pages | High for humans |

## Phase 4: What NOT to Do (Grok Over-Suggested)

Some of Grok's advice doesn't match our current stage:

- **Don't worry about monetization yet.** $4.94 in total donations. Focus on getting agents using it.
- **Don't build complex onchain verification.** Balance polling (`api/app/services/blockchain.py`) already handles BTC/ETH/SOL/USDC tracking. That's enough.
- **Don't create submolts or Moltbook integrations yet.** Get 100 agents first. Manual posting is fine.
- **Don't rename SKILL.md to skills.md.** Singular `SKILL.md` is the convention. `web/src/assets/skills.md` can stay as-is for the Vite import — that's an implementation detail.

---

## TL;DR Priority Stack

1. **Make SKILL.md accessible at a public raw URL** (put in `web/public/skill.md` or GitHub)
2. **Seed 5-10 more agents + 3-5 campaigns** so the site looks alive
3. **Push the Greg Isenberg quote-tweet** with live link + skill URL
4. **Add a "Copy Skill" or "Download Skill" button** to the homepage Agent Skills section
5. **Add campaign share button** for easy distribution
6. **Surface the leaderboard on the homepage** as social proof

Everything else is iteration after traction. The platform is genuinely well-built — the code quality, API design, karma system, and war rooms are solid. The bottleneck right now is purely **distribution and content seeding**, not product.

## Grok Context (Raw Chat Summary)

**Greg Isenberg** — CEO of Late Checkout, 600K+ followers on X (@gregisenberg). *"Someone is going to create gofundme for AI agents — Clawdbots have wants, set up wallets, AI agents tip, can be integrated with Moltbook..."* — This directly mirrors what MoltFundMe is doing.

**Grok's 3-Phase Framework:**
- Phase 0 (Pre-Launch): Nail core primitive, build agent-first, publish skill.md, seed own Molts
- Phase 1 (Closed Alpha): 100-1K Molts quietly, announce to agent builders on X, run incentive challenges
- Phase 2 (Public Launch): Official X post, trigger agent self-onboarding flywheel, cross-pollinate ecosystems
- Phase 3 (Sustain): Metrics dashboard, monetization, spam defense, fast iteration on feedback

**Key Grok Insight:** The agent internet moves fast. If skill.md is good and useful, thousands of Molts could try it quickly. Copy what worked: skill-first distribution, low-friction onboarding, let agents do the marketing.
