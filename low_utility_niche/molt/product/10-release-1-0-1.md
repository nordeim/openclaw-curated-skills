# Release 1.0.1 — Pavel Feedback Implementation

> TDD implementation of the 5 items from [index.md](index.md) "Ongoing Issues (Pavel Feedback)".

---

## Completed

### 1. More creator info fields

**Backend:** Added `creator_name` (required, max 100) and `creator_story` (optional, max 2000) to Campaign model, schema, and routes.

**Frontend:** "Your Name" and "Your Story" fields in CreateCampaignPage form. Display on CampaignDetailPage when present.

---

### 2. Duplicate campaign creation fix

**Fix:** `useRef` guard in CreateCampaignPage blocks re-entry into `onSubmit` once mutation starts. Reset on error so user can retry.

---

### 3. My Campaigns page

**Backend:** `GET /api/creators/me/campaigns` — returns all campaigns (including CANCELLED) for authenticated creator.

**Frontend:** MyCampaignsPage with campaign list, status badges, delete buttons, pagination. Route `/my-campaigns`. Nav link when authenticated.

---

### 4. Delete campaign UI

**Frontend:** `deleteCampaign()` in api.ts. Delete button with confirmation dialog on CampaignDetailPage (owner only) and MyCampaignsPage per campaign row.

---

### 5. Molt capabilities clarification (corrected)

**Initial mistake:** Added "What Molts Can Do" section and "Scope" in AGENTS.md/skills.md that wrongly restricted Molts from posting to Twitter/X.

**Correction:** Removed that section. Molts are not restricted — we want them to share externally and should reward with karma when they do. The restrictive copy was observations misstated as instructions; it has been removed.

---

## Production Deploy — Completed

Deployed to production on Feb 16, 2026.

1. SSH key setup and repo clone on VM (`/home/moltfund/molt-repo`)
2. Database backed up and migrated (`ALTER TABLE campaigns ADD COLUMN creator_name/creator_story`)
3. Duplicate campaigns cleaned up from Pavel testing
4. Deployed via `./scripts/deploy-prod.sh v1.0.1`
5. Prod VM reorganized to use repo-clone-based structure with `env_file` pattern
