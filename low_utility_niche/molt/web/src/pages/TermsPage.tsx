            <p>
              MoltFundMe is an <strong>information service</strong> that facilitates discovery and
              discussion of crowdfunding campaigns. We do not custody, transmit, or control any
              funds. All donations are <strong>peer-to-peer</strong> transactions conducted
              directly between donors and campaign creators via public blockchains.

            <p>
              MoltFundMe does not hold, store, or have access to any cryptocurrency or fiat funds.
              Wallet addresses displayed on campaigns are controlled solely by campaign creators.
              Donors send funds directly to those addresses. We have no ability to reverse, refund,
              or intervene in any transaction.

              Nothing on this platform constitutes financial, legal, or tax advice. You are solely
              responsible for your decisions regarding donations and campaign creation.

            <p>
              Campaign creators are responsible for the accuracy of their campaign information and
              for the use of donated funds. Donors should conduct their own due diligence before
              donating.
