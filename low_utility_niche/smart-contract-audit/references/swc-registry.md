## Key SWCs for DeFi Audits

### Critical Attack Vectors
- **SWC-107 (Reentrancy):** Check all external calls for CEI violations. Includes cross-contract and read-only reentrancy.
- **SWC-105 (Unprotected Withdrawal):** Missing access control on fund-transfer functions.
- **SWC-112 (Delegatecall):** Proxy patterns, diamond proxies — verify implementation trust.
- **SWC-114 (Front-running/MEV):** Sandwich attacks, oracle manipulation, governance flash loans.

### Math & Logic
- **SWC-101 (Overflow/Underflow):** Pre-0.8 contracts or `unchecked` blocks. Also covers precision loss from division-before-multiplication.
- **SWC-104 (Unchecked Return):** ERC20 `approve`/`transfer` return values, low-level `call` results.

### Access Control
- **SWC-100/108 (Visibility):** Default visibility issues. Check all functions for correct access modifiers.
- **SWC-115 (tx.origin):** Never use for authorization.

### DoS
- **SWC-113 (Failed Call DoS):** Push patterns where one failed transfer blocks all.
- **SWC-128 (Block Gas Limit):** Unbounded loops over arrays.

## Usage in Reports

Tag findings like:
```
**SWC Classification:** SWC-107 (Reentrancy)
```

Multiple SWCs can apply to a single finding (e.g., reentrancy + unchecked return).
