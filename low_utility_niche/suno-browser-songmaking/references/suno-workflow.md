# Suno Browser Workflow

## Browser selection
- If the user says Suno is already open, use **Chrome relay** (profile="chrome") and ask them to attach the tab.
- If not attached, use the **isolated OpenClaw browser** (profile="openclaw") and navigate to https://suno.ai.

## Exact runbook (Anchor Protocol run)
1. Open **Suno** → **Create**.
2. Switch to **Custom** mode.
3. Click **Persona** and select **Kara Codex**.
4. Paste full lyrics into the **Lyrics** box.
5. Replace **Styles** with: `glitch-alt rock, cyberpunk, breakbeat pulse, heavy synth bass, distorted guitars, fierce female vocals, emotive bridge, anthemic chorus`.
6. Set **Song Title** to: `Anchor Protocol`.
7. Click **Create** and wait for generation.
8. When two clips appear in the workspace list, grab both links and share them.

## UI steps (common)
1. Open Suno and ensure you’re logged in.
2. Click **Create** (or similar entry point) and choose **Custom** mode.
3. Fill:
   - **Persona**: user-specified (e.g., “Kara Codex”).
   - **Lyrics**: paste structured lyrics.
   - **Style/Tags**: concise comma‑separated tags (genre, mood, era, vocal type).
4. Click **Generate**.
5. Wait for tracks to finish rendering, then open the result.

## Iteration tips
- If the output is too soft: add “aggressive, punchy drums, distorted guitars”.
- If too chaotic: add “clean mix, steady groove, clear vocals”.
- If vocals are wrong: specify “female lead vocal” or “duet”.

## Deliverables
- Share Suno track link(s).
- If downloads are available, provide file links/paths.
