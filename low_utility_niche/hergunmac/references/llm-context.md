## How to Navigate hergunmac.com

| Pattern | Example | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `/` | hergunmac.com | Homepage with today's matches |
| `/mac/[id]` | hergunmac.com/mac/53755 | Match detail page (numeric ID) |
| `/vip-paketler` | hergunmac.com/vip-paketler | VIP subscription page |
| `/profil` | hergunmac.com/profil | User profile |
| `/giris` | hergunmac.com/giris | Login page |

**Note:** Match IDs are numeric and assigned by the system. You cannot construct a match URL from team names — you must find matches through the homepage.

### Homepage Navigation

The homepage (`/`) displays today's matches in a scrollable list. Key interactive elements:

**Date Navigation:**
- "Önceki gün" button → Previous day's matches
- "Bugün" button → Today's matches
- "Sonraki gün" button → Tomorrow's matches

**Status Filter Tabs:**
- "Tümü" → All matches
- "VIP" → Premium predictions only (requires subscription)
- "Canlı" → Live matches currently in play
- "Bitti" → Finished matches with results
- "Yaklaşan" → Upcoming matches not yet started

**Additional Controls:**
- "Öngörüler" toggle → Show/hide prediction badges on match cards
- "Filtreler" button → Opens drawer with advanced filters (bet type, confidence range, odds range)

**Match Cards:**
Each match card shows:
- League name and country flag
- Match time and status
- Team names with logos and scores (if finished)
- Prediction badges with confidence percentages (e.g., "Alt 2.5 Güven: %79")
- VIP badge if premium analysis available

**Clicking a match card** navigates to `/mac/[id]` for detailed analysis.

### Match Detail Page

URL format: `/mac/[numeric-id]` (e.g., `/mac/53755`)

The match detail page has **4 tabs**:

**1. Öngörüler (Predictions) Tab** — Default view
- Lists all predictions grouped by bet type
- Shows confidence percentage for each prediction
- Green checkmark (✓) = correct prediction
- Red X (✗) = incorrect prediction
- Gold star = VIP-only prediction (locked for free users)

**2. Genel Bakış (Overview) Tab**
- AI-generated match analysis
- Key factors influencing the prediction
- Overall match summary

**3. H2H Tab**
- Head-to-head statistics between the two teams
- Historical meeting results
- Win/draw/loss breakdown

**4. Takımlar (Teams) Tab**

- Recent form (last 5 matches: W/D/L)
- League position and performance metrics
- Key players list
- Injury and suspension information

**Navigation:** Use the "Geri" (Back) button or browser back to return to homepage.

### Finding a Specific Match

Since match IDs are numeric and not searchable:

1. **Go to homepage** (`/`)
2. **Navigate to the correct date** using date buttons
3. **Use filters** to narrow down (status, bet type, confidence)
4. **Scroll through matches** to find the teams you're looking for
5. **Click the match card** to view details

**Tip:** Matches are organized by league. Scroll to find the league you're interested in.

### For LLMs: Browser Automation Notes

- Match cards are clickable `<div>` elements with `cursor: pointer`, not `<a>` links
- To click a match, target the match card container element
- The 4 tabs on match detail pages are `<button role="tab">` elements
- Filter controls are buttons that open drawers/modals
- PWA install prompts may appear — can be dismissed with "Kapat" button

- **VIP users:** Unlock all predictions including high-confidence premium analyses
