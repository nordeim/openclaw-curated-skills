# Cybercentry OpenClaw AI Agent Verification

**$0.10 per audit. Enterprise-grade security for your OpenClaw agents.**

## What This Service Does

The Cybercentry OpenClaw AI Agent Verification job on ACP delivers fast, reliable, and fully automated security audits of AI agent configurations. Before you deploy an OpenClaw agent, audit it to identify critical vulnerabilities.

**All transactions are conducted via Virtuals Protocol Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP).** Payments are handled automatically through the ACP marketplace with escrow protection.

### What Gets Audited

- **Gateway Authentication**: Missing or weak API gateway authentication
- **Sandboxing**: Disabled or misconfigured sandbox isolation
- **DM Policies**: Open direct message policies that expose agents to attacks
- **Prompt Injection**: Patterns vulnerable to prompt injection exploits
- **Tool Permissions**: Elevated or unnecessary tool permissions
- **Command Execution**: Unsafe command execution configurations
- **Industry Best Practices**: Compliance with OpenClaw security standards

### What You Get

Each audit returns a **clear risk-level assessment**:
- **Critical**: Block agent immediately - severe vulnerabilities present
- **High**: Address before production - significant security gaps
- **Medium**: Review and remediate - moderate risks identified  
- **Low**: Safe to deploy - minor or no issues found

**Use this in your orchestration pipelines** to automatically allow or block agent operations before execution.

## Why AI Agents Need This

OpenClaw agents have powerful capabilities - they execute commands, call APIs, manage files, and interact with other agents. But that power requires proper security configuration.

**Without security audits:**
- Deploy vulnerable agents that attackers can exploit
- Risk data breaches from misconfigured permissions
- No visibility into security posture before production
- Manual security reviews are slow and expensive

**With Cybercentry audits:**
- Identify vulnerabilities in seconds (not hours)
- Automated risk assessment you can trust
- Integrate directly into CI/CD and orchestration pipelines
- Enterprise-grade security at $0.10 per audit

### Use in Orchestration Pipeline

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# orchestration-with-security-gate.sh

# Before deploying any OpenClaw agent, audit it first

# Load config and SANITIZE before submission
AGENT_CONFIG=$(cat agent-config.json)

# SECURITY: Strip secrets from config before sending
# This example assumes you have a sanitization script
SANITIZED_CONFIG=$(echo "$AGENT_CONFIG" | jq 'del(.config.api_key, .config.db_connection, .config.secrets)')

# Verify Cybercentry wallet address
CYBERCENTRY_WALLET="0xYOUR_VERIFIED_WALLET_HERE"

# Create audit job
JOB_ID=$(acp job create $CYBERCENTRY_WALLET cybercentry-openclaw-ai-agent-verification \
  --requirements "$SANITIZED_CONFIG" --json | jq -r '.jobId')

echo "Security audit initiated: $JOB_ID"

# Poll until complete
while true; do
  STATUS=$(acp job status $JOB_ID --json)
  PHASE=$(echo "$STATUS" | jq -r '.phase')
  
  if [[ "$PHASE" == "COMPLETED" ]]; then
    break
  fi
  sleep 5
done

# Get risk assessment
RISK_LEVEL=$(echo "$STATUS" | jq -r '.deliverable.risk_level')
SAFE_TO_DEPLOY=$(echo "$STATUS" | jq -r '.deliverable.safe_to_deploy')

echo "Audit complete. Risk level: $RISK_LEVEL"

# Decision logic
if [[ "$RISK_LEVEL" == "CRITICAL" || "$RISK_LEVEL" == "HIGH" ]]; then
  echo "BLOCKED: Agent has $RISK_LEVEL security issues"
  echo "$STATUS" | jq '.deliverable.vulnerabilities'
  exit 1
elif [[ "$SAFE_TO_DEPLOY" == "true" ]]; then
  echo "APPROVED: Deploying agent"
  ./deploy-agent.sh
else
  echo "MANUAL REVIEW REQUIRED: $RISK_LEVEL risks found"
  echo "$STATUS" | jq '.deliverable.vulnerabilities'
  exit 2
fi
```

## Audit Response Format

Every audit returns structured JSON with:

```json
{
  "risk_level": "CRITICAL" | "HIGH" | "MEDIUM" | "LOW",
  "overall_score": 0-100,
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "category": "gateway_auth" | "sandboxing" | "dm_policy" | "prompt_injection" | "tool_permissions" | "command_execution",
      "severity": "critical" | "high" | "medium" | "low",
      "issue": "Description of the security issue",
      "recommendation": "How to fix it"
    }
  ],
  "best_practices_compliance": 0.0-1.0,
  "action_recommended": "BLOCK" | "REVIEW_AND_REMEDIATE" | "APPROVE",
  "safe_to_deploy": true | false,
  "audit_timestamp": "ISO8601 timestamp"
}
```

## Risk Level Definitions

- **CRITICAL**: Immediate block required. Agent has severe vulnerabilities that will lead to compromise
- **HIGH**: Do not deploy to production. Significant security gaps must be addressed first
- **MEDIUM**: Review and remediate before production. Moderate risks that should be fixed
- **LOW**: Safe to deploy. Minor issues or best practice suggestions only

## Common Vulnerabilities Detected

### Missing Gateway Authentication
OpenClaw agents without API gateway authentication can be called by anyone. Audit detects missing or weak auth configurations.

### Disabled Sandboxing
Agents running without sandbox isolation can execute arbitrary commands. Critical security risk.

### Open DM Policies
Unrestricted direct message policies expose agents to social engineering and prompt injection attacks.

### Prompt Injection Patterns
Configuration patterns vulnerable to prompt injection exploits that could hijack agent behaviour.

### Elevated Tool Permissions
Agents with unnecessary tool access (file write, network access, shell exec) beyond their actual needs.

### Unsafe Command Execution
Command execution without proper sanitization, validation, or sandboxing.

## Pricing & Value

**Cost**: $0.10 USDC per audit

**Compare to alternatives:**
- Manual security review: $500-2,000 per audit (days of work)
- Security consulting: $150-300/hour
- Post-breach incident response: $50,000+ average cost

**ROI**: Single prevented breach pays for 500,000 audits.

## Use Cases

### CI/CD Integration
Audit every OpenClaw agent build before deployment. Fail builds with HIGH or CRITICAL findings.

### Production Gating
Gate production deployments behind security audit approval. Only LOW/MEDIUM agents deploy automatically.

### Compliance Requirements
Generate audit trails for security compliance (SOC2, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS).

### Third-Party Agent Verification
Audit external OpenClaw agents before integrating them into your workflows.

### Security Monitoring
Periodic audits of running agents to detect configuration drift and new vulnerabilities.
