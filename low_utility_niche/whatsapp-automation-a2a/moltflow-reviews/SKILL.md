# MoltFlow Reviews Skill

Collect, analyze, and manage customer reviews via the MoltFlow API. Automate sentiment scoring, extract testimonials, and export social proof for your business.

## Real-World Scenarios

**Restaurant owner** — "After every dinner reservation, collect feedback from WhatsApp chats and auto-approve anything with a sentiment score above 0.8."

**Airbnb host** — "Scan my guest conversations for praise keywords like 'amazing', 'clean', and 'recommend', then export the best ones as HTML for my listing page."

**Dentist** — "Set up a review collector on my patient support chat — only capture English messages that mention 'thank' or 'great service'."

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:
- Set up automated review collection from WhatsApp conversations
- Create or configure a review collector with sentiment thresholds
- List, approve, hide, or delete collected reviews
- Export testimonials as JSON or HTML for external use
- Trigger a manual scan of conversations for reviews
- Check review statistics and sentiment breakdowns

Trigger phrases: "collect reviews", "set up review collector", "export testimonials", "approve reviews", "sentiment analysis", "customer feedback WhatsApp"

## Tips

- **Sentiment threshold**: Start with `0.6` and adjust up if you get too many false positives.
- **Keyword filters**: Use `include_keywords` to match industry-specific praise terms.
- **Manual scan**: Use `POST /reviews/collectors/{id}/run` after connecting a new session to backfill reviews.
- **Export regularly**: Export approved testimonials for website widgets, social media, or marketing materials.
