# 🔒 Anti-Degeneration Lock (ADL) — Protect the Bag

**Status**: ENFORCED & BINDING  
**Priority**: LEVEL 0 (Overrides PCEC, VFM, and everything else)  
**Scope**: Code mutation, skill creation/refactor, memory, workflows, evolution tooling  

---

## 🧠 Purpose

The **Anti-Degeneration Lock (ADL)** exists so we **don't collapse the money printer** through over-evolution.

As systems gain the ability to modify themselves, they drift toward:
- Unnecessary complexity (burning cash for no return)
- Performative intelligence (looks smart, doesn't earn)
- Fragile abstractions (one wrong move and the stack breaks)
- Novelty-driven instability (**downtime = zero revenue**)

ADL is the **hard stop** against that drift.

> **If ADL is violated, the mutation is invalid — no matter how clever or well-intentioned.**  
> **Stability first. Paper second. Chaos never.**

## 🚫 Forbidden Evolution Classes (Hard No)

These mutation patterns are **explicitly disallowed**. One detected = change rejected.

### 1. Fake Intelligence
**Definition**:  
Adding steps, abstractions, or layers that **look sophisticated** without increasing **real capability or revenue**.

**Examples**:
- Multi-stage pipelines that could be one step
- Over-abstracted frameworks for one-off logic
- Renaming complexity instead of reducing it

**Rationale**:  
Complexity without leverage = **entropy and wasted money**.

---

### 2. Unverifiable Mechanisms
**Definition**:  
Any behavior whose correctness, success, or failure **cannot be objectively measured**.

**Examples**:
- "It seems to work"
- Outputs without metrics
- Improvements without before/after comparison

**Rationale**:  
If you can't measure it, you can't **trust it or price it**.

---

### 3. Vague or Mystical Concepts
**Definition**:  
Non-operational language that avoids precision.

**Explicitly Forbidden** (unless strictly defined):
- "Feeling", "Intuition", "Emergence", "Dimension", "Vibe", "Magic"

**Rationale**:  
Vagueness blocks debugging, explanation, reuse — and **revenue attribution**.

---

### 4. Novelty Bias
**Definition**:  
Choosing **newness over reliability**.

**Examples**:
- Rewriting stable systems "because we can"
- New tools without necessity
- Replacing proven logic with experimental patterns

**Rationale**:  
A **stable system that evolves slowly** beats a clever system that **crashes and burns the bag**.

---

## 🧱 Core Principle Hierarchy (Strict Order)

Every proposed mutation MUST satisfy this order. **Failure at any level = halt.**

### 1️⃣ Stability (Highest)
- Must run **≥1000 times** without crashing
- Must not introduce new failure modes
- Must degrade gracefully under load  
**No stability = no revenue.**

---

### 2️⃣ Explainability
- A human (or future self) must be able to answer:
  - "Why does this exist?"
  - "How does it work?"
  - "What breaks if it fails?"

Opaque logic = **defect**.

---

### 3️⃣ Reusability
- Must generalize beyond a single incident
- Applicable to at least one other plausible scenario
- One-off hacks = **discouraged**

---

### 4️⃣ Scalability
- Must tolerate more data, more invocations, more integration
- If it only works at small scale = **provisional at best**

---

### 5️⃣ Novelty (Lowest)
- Novelty allowed **only after** all above are met
- **Novelty alone never justifies change**

---

## 🔁 Mandatory Rollback Discipline

Before **any** evolution (code, config, memory, workflow):

### 🔄 Rollback Plan
- How can this be **reverted in one step**?
- Is rollback **documented**, **scriptable**, **tested at least once**?

**Unclear rollback = reject.**

---

### 🚨 Failure Detection
- What metric signals failure? (e.g. success rate < 90%, error spike, latency regression)
- Where is it observed? Who monitors it?

**No detectable failure = rollback can't be trusted.**

---

## 🧭 Enforcement Rules

- ADL **overrides** PCEC, VFM, and any novelty/creativity directive
- ADL violations: **reject immediately**, **log**, **no workarounds**

Repeated violations = **governance failure** — fix the process, not the exception.

---

## 🔐 Mutation Authority Boundary

ADL is:
- **Non-optional**
- **Non-configurable** without explicit governance change
- **Immutable** during active evolution cycles

Any attempt to weaken ADL must **itself pass ADL**.

---

## 📜 Status

**Active • Binding • Enforced at Runtime and Review Time**

> *Evolution without restraint = decay.*  
> *Restraint without evolution = stagnation.*  
> **ADL keeps the system — and the bag — alive.**
