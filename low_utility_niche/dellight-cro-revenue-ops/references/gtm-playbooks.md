# Go-To-Market Playbooks

## Phase 1: Founder-Led Sales (NOW)
**Objective**: First 10 paying customers within 60 days.

### LinkedIn Strategy (Primary Channel)
1. Arthur publishes 3x/week: thought leadership + product demos
2. Every post has a CTA: "DM me" or "Link in comments"
3. Engage with 50 relevant profiles daily (comment, not just like)
4. Direct outreach to warm network (enterprise contacts from 34 years)

### Target Customer Profile (ICP)
- **Industry**: Media agencies, corporate marketing, SaaS companies
- **Size**: 50-500 employees (big enough to pay, small enough to decide fast)
- **Pain**: Spending $10K+/month on video production
- **Location**: UAE, GCC, then expand to EU/US
- **Trigger**: Recent job posting for video editor, or content marketing role

### Outreach Template
```
Subject: Cutting video production costs by 90%

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is scaling content production.
We built a Media Production Engine that generates
professional video from a text brief — at 10% of
traditional agency costs.

Would a 5-minute demo be worth your time?
