# Security Audit Report

**Package:** perplexity-search  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Audit Date:** 2026-02-04  
**Status:** ✅ PASS - Ready for publication

## Summary

This skill has been reviewed for security vulnerabilities and follows OpenClaw security best practices. No critical or high-severity issues found.

## Security Features

### ✅ API Key Protection
- **Status:** SECURE
- API key loaded from environment variable only
- Never hardcoded or logged
- Not exposed in error messages
- Recommended storage: OpenClaw config (encrypted at rest)

### ✅ Input Validation
- **Status:** SECURE
- Query: Passed as-is to API (Perplexity handles sanitization)
- Count: Clamped between 1-10
- Recency: Whitelist validation (day/week/month/year only)
- No shell execution or file operations

### ✅ Output Sanitization
- **Status:** SECURE
- ANSI escape sequences stripped
- Prevents terminal injection attacks
- Snippet truncation (200 chars max in formatted output)

### ✅ Network Security
- **Status:** SECURE
- HTTPS only (api.perplexity.ai/search)
- 30-second timeout prevents hanging
- Proper error handling
- URLError and HTTPError caught

### ✅ Error Handling
- **Status:** SECURE
- HTTP error codes exposed, not response bodies
- Network errors sanitized
- No stack traces in production output
- Exit codes used appropriately (0=success, 1=error)

### ✅ Dependencies
- **Status:** SECURE
- Zero external dependencies
- Uses Python stdlib only:
  - `urllib` (builtin)
  - `argparse` (builtin)
  - `json` (builtin)
  - `re` (builtin)
- No supply chain risks

## Threat Model

### Protected Against

| Threat | Protection | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| API key exposure | Environment variables only | ✅ |
| Terminal injection | ANSI sanitization | ✅ |
| Command injection | No shell execution | ✅ |
| Path traversal | No file operations | ✅ |
| DoS (hanging) | 30s timeout | ✅ |
| Error information disclosure | Sanitized error messages | ✅ |
| Supply chain attacks | No dependencies | ✅ |

### Not Applicable

- **SQL Injection:** No database
- **XSS:** No web interface
- **CSRF:** No web interface
- **Authentication bypass:** API key required (enforced by Perplexity)

## Recommendations

### For Users

1. **API Key Storage:**
   ```json
   {
     "skills": {
       "perplexity-search": {
         "env": {
           "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "your-key-here"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   
2. **Permissions:** No elevated permissions required

3. **Rate Limiting:** Monitor usage at https://perplexity.ai/account/api

### For Developers

If forking/modifying this skill:
- Keep `sanitize_output()` intact
- Don't log API responses (may contain PII from search results)
- Don't add shell execution (`subprocess`, `os.system`, etc.)
- Keep timeout at 30s or lower
- Test with malicious inputs (ANSI codes, special chars)
