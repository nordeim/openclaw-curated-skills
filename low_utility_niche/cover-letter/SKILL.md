- "After leading [Company]'s biggest product launch, I'm ready to bring that energy to [Target Company]."

**Avoid:**
- "I am writing to apply for..." (boring)
- "I believe I would be a great fit..." (generic)
- "To whom it may concern" (impersonal)
- Starting with your life story

### Quantify Your Achievements

| Instead of | Write |
|------------|-------|
| "Increased sales" | "Grew sales 45% YoY, adding $2M in revenue" |
| "Managed a team" | "Led 12-person team across 3 time zones" |
| "Improved efficiency" | "Reduced processing time from 5 days to 4 hours" |

4. **Too long** - Keep to one page, 3-4 paragraphs
5. **Typos and errors** - Proofread multiple times
6. **Wrong company name** - Double-check before sending

## Examples

### Example: Tech Role Cover Letter

**Input:** "Write a cover letter for a Senior Software Engineer role at Stripe. I have 6 years of Python/Go experience, built payment systems at my current company, and I'm passionate about fintech."

**Output:**

Dear Hiring Manager,

Building payment infrastructure that processes $50M+ monthly has been the highlight of my engineering career – and it's exactly why I'm excited about the Senior Software Engineer role at Stripe. Your mission to increase the GDP of the internet resonates deeply with my experience making financial technology accessible and reliable.

At [Current Company], I architected our core payment processing system using Python and Go, reducing transaction failures by 40% and improving throughput from 1,000 to 10,000 transactions per second. I led the integration with multiple payment providers and implemented fraud detection systems that prevented $2M in potential losses. This work required not just technical excellence but a deep understanding of financial regulations and user trust.

What draws me to Stripe specifically is your developer-first approach. I've used Stripe's APIs extensively and appreciate the thoughtfulness in your documentation and SDKs. The opportunity to build infrastructure that millions of businesses depend on, while working alongside engineers who've set the standard for API design, is exactly the challenge I'm seeking.

I would love to discuss how my payment systems expertise and passion for fintech can contribute to Stripe's continued growth. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
