# Technology & Market Decision Framework

## RAPID Decision Model (Adapted for AI Startup)
**R**ecommend, Person=CIO / CRO, Responsibility=Propose the decision with supporting data
**A**gree, Person=CRO (commercial) / CTO (technical), Responsibility=Must agree for decision to proceed
**P**erform, Person=Assigned team/agent, Responsibility=Execute the decision
**I**nput, Person=CMO, CFO, Responsibility=Provide data and perspective
**D**ecide, Person=CEO (Arthur), Responsibility=Final authority on strategic decisions

## Decision Evaluation Matrix
Score each option on:

Revenue impact (30 days), Weight=30%, Score (1-5)=
Revenue impact (90 days), Weight=20%, Score (1-5)=
Competitive advantage, Weight=15%, Score (1-5)=
Implementation effort, Weight=15%, Score (1-5)=
Risk of disruption, Weight=10%, Score (1-5)=
Strategic alignment, Weight=10%, Score (1-5)=

**Weighted Score = Σ (Weight × Score)**

## Speed of Decision
Tactical (tool choice, content topic), Max Time=Immediate, Who Decides=CRO/CMO
Operational (pricing change, campaign launch), Max Time=24 hours, Who Decides=CRO + CEO
Strategic (new product, pivot, partnership), Max Time=72 hours, Who Decides=CEO with CRO input
Existential (funding, company direction), Max Time=1 week, Who Decides=CEO

**Default**: If in doubt, decide faster. Reversible decisions should take minutes, not days.
