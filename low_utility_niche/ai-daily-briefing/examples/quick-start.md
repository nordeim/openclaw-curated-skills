## Step 2: Get Your Overview

You'll see:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
☀️ DAILY BRIEFING — [Today's Date]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚠️ OVERDUE — [items past due]
📅 TODAY'S PRIORITIES — [what to focus on]

## Make It Better

### Add a To-Do List

The more data you have, the better your briefings:

1. Use **ai-meeting-notes** to extract action items from meetings
2. Those items automatically populate your to-do list
3. Your briefings show overdue items and priorities

### Connect Your Calendar

If calendar integration is available:
- Today's meetings appear automatically
- Prep time is highlighted
- Conflicts are flagged

---

## Other Commands

| Say This | Get This |
|----------|----------|
| "what's overdue?" | Just overdue items |
| "weekly preview" | Week-ahead view |
| "what's on my calendar?" | Today's schedule |
| "what should I focus on?" | Priority recommendation |

---

## That's It

Say "briefing" → Get clarity → Start your day.
