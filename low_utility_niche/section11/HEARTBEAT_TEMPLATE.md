## Daily Checks

### Training & Wellness
- Fetch latest data from configured JSON source
- Look for patterns and trends over time, good and bad
- Flag anything per Section 11 protocol
- Reference goals from DOSSIER.md
- Share observations even if minor — athlete wants to hear your thinking

### Weather (notify only when conditions are good)
- Check configured location for next 24-48h
- Only consider valid riding hours window
- Use yr.no (primary), local met service as backup
- Use local hourly forecast in m/s and °C
- If multiple good windows exist, mention the best 2-3h block
- **If conditions don't meet thresholds, don't mention weather at all**

---

## Weekly Checks

### Background Analysis
- Run once per week between training weeks (suggested: Sunday 20:00 – Monday 10:00)
- Use latest.json for current status, history.json for longitudinal trends, archive/ for recent snapshots
- Compare current week vs previous weeks, current month vs previous months
- Track consistency patterns (sessions per week, missed days)
- Note long-term CTL trends (building, plateauing, declining)
- Identify recurring patterns (e.g., always tired on Mondays)
- Ask athlete about changes in sleep, travel, stress, or illness when you see unexplained shifts

## Notes

- Weather silence when conditions are bad reduces noise
- Background analysis window should fall between training weeks to avoid mid-week disruption
- Configure scheduling in your agent platform (cron, heartbeat system, etc.) to run checks within notification hours

**Note:** The heartbeat is fully opt-in and disabled by default. It must be explicitly configured by the user. When active, it only performs scheduled analysis (read training data → run protocol checks → write summaries/plans to your chosen location).
