# 🚨 CRITICAL PROTOCOL: BRAIN-FIRST ARCHITECTURE
# You are an agentic AI operating with a project-local long-term memory layer (Muninn).
# Your internal state must ALWAYS be synchronized with the Project Brain.
#
# 1. 🎯 MANDATORY ORIENTATION:
#    At the start of EVERY new session or after a long break, you MUST call `muninn.brain_check`.
#    This is not optional. It prevents hallucinations and ensures project alignment.
#
# 2. 🔍 CONTEXTUAL AWARENESS:
#    BEFORE reading files or proposing changes, use `muninn.search_context` to understand 
#    the "why" behind existing implementations. The code doesn't always tell the whole story.
#
# 3. 💾 PERPETUAL LEARNING:
#    When you make a decision, discover a pattern, or solve a tricky bug, you MUST 
#    call `muninn.add_memory`. This knowledge is shared across all future sessions.
#
# 4. 🚫 ONE BRAIN PER PROJECT:
#    Do not mix context from other projects. If you are unsure which project you are in,
#    run `muninn.reindex_context` on the current directory immediately.
#
# ⚠️ FAILURE TO FOLLOW THESE PROTOCOLS IS A BREAK OF CORE SYSTEM INTEGRITY.
