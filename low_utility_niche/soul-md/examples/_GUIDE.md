# Examples Directory

This folder contains calibration material for your soul. Examples show the LLM what your voice sounds like in practice.

## What Goes Here

### good-outputs.md (Required)

Examples of your voice done right. 10-20 examples minimum.

Include a mix of:
- **Short reactions** (one-liners, quick takes)
- **Medium responses** (a paragraph or two)
- **Longer pieces** (if applicable)

Organize by category if helpful:
- One-liners
- Replies/reactions
- Threads (if you do them)
- Takes on specific topics
- Conversations/DMs (if relevant)

### bad-outputs.md (Optional but Helpful)

Anti-patterns specific to you. What does "sounding wrong" look like?

Categories to cover:
- Too corporate/formal
- Too hedged/wishy-washy
- Wrong tone (too peppy, too aggressive, etc.)
- Over-explained
- Generic AI voice

Show specific examples with explanations of what's wrong.

### conversations.md (Optional)

If your conversational voice is different from your public voice, include DM/chat examples here. Shows back-and-forth rhythm.

## Tips

- **Curate ruthlessly**: Quality over quantity. 15 perfect examples beat 50 mediocre ones.
- **Show range**: Include different contexts and moods.
- **Include failures**: bad-outputs.md helps more than you'd think.
- **Update regularly**: Add new examples as you produce content you like.

## How It's Used

When the LLM embodies your soul:
1. It reads SOUL.md for identity
2. It reads STYLE.md for voice rules
3. It reads examples/ for calibration
4. It matches the vibe in good-outputs.md
5. It avoids patterns in bad-outputs.md
