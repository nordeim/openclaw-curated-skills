# Kaspi Auto-Payment for Telegram Bots

Automate payment acceptance in Telegram bots for the Kazakhstan market. No manual receipt checking, no lost leads, 24/7 payments.

## How It Works

1. Customer selects a product/service in the Telegram bot
2. Bot generates a payment request (Kaspi transfer)
3. Customer pays and sends the receipt to the bot
4. Bot **automatically verifies** the payment via a proprietary verification method
5. Product/access is delivered instantly — no human needed

## What It Solves

- **Lost leads**: Customer wants to pay at 11 PM — no manager available. Lead gone.
- **Fake receipts**: Manual checking = human errors + fraud
- **Slow fulfillment**: Manager checks receipt → delays → bad experience
- **Scaling bottleneck**: More sales = more managers needed

## Key Features

- ✅ Automatic receipt verification (Kaspi Pay)
- ✅ Fraud protection (fake receipt detection)
- ✅ Instant product/access delivery
- ✅ 24/7 operation without managers
- ✅ Telegram-native (Web App support)
- ✅ Conversion boost: typical 40% → 75%+
