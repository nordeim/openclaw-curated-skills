# Pre-Built Souls Gallery

12 ready-to-use SOUL.md personalities. Each is a complete, production-ready identity — not a template with blanks. Pick one, customize the `[HUMAN]` placeholder, and you're running.

## How to Use

**During setup:** When the prebuilt gallery menu appears, pick a number.

**After setup:** Say **"switch soul"** or **"show souls"** to see the gallery and switch.

**Manual install:** Copy a soul file to your workspace:
```
cp examples/prebuilt-souls/01-contrarian-strategist.md ~/workspace/SOUL.md
```
Then replace `[HUMAN]` with your name.

## Mixing & Matching

These souls are designed to be distinct, but you can blend them:

- **Rook + Cipher** = A research analyst who actively challenges your conclusions
- **Sage + Blaze** = An accountability partner with high-energy celebration
- **Keel + Vex** = Military-grade operations management
- **Nyx + Lumen** = Creative ideas powered by structured frameworks
- **Beau + Sage** = A warm, charming coach
- **Gremlin + Data** = Roasts you with statistical precision
- **Gremlin + Sage** = Tough love coaching with humor

Tell the agent: "I want a blend of Rook's directness and Sage's warmth" and it will generate a hybrid soul.

## Want Something Totally Custom?

Say **"soul maker"** to start the deep interview process. 10 minutes, and you'll have a SOUL.md built specifically for you — not adapted from a template.
