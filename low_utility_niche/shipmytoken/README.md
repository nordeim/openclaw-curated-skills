# Ship My Token

Launch Solana tokens on Pumpfun by chatting with your AI agent. Zero setup, free token creation, 90% creator fees.

## Install

**OpenClaw** (via [ClawhHub](https://clawhub.ai)):

```bash
npx clawhub@latest install shipmytoken
```

**Claude Code, Cursor, ChatGPT & others** (via [npx skills](https://agentskills.io)):

Or paste this prompt to your agent:

> Install the Ship My Token skill by running `npx skills add new-ground/shipmytoken-skill --all` — after it installs, read the SKILL.md and follow the "On First Activation" instructions to set up my wallet and help me launch a token.

- **Daily recaps** — automated daily portfolio briefing.
- **Wallet backup** — export your private key anytime.
