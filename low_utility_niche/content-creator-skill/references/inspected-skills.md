# Inspected Upstream Skills

Directly inspected from ClawHub:

- `humanizer` latest `1.0.0`
- `de-ai-ify` latest `1.0.0`
- `copywriting` latest `0.1.0`
- `tweet-writer` latest `1.0.0`

## Mapping notes

- Requested `/humanizer` maps to `humanizer` as primary.
- If a numeric AI-likeness score is explicitly required, `ai-humanizer` can be used as an optional scoring layer; `humanizer` itself is primarily rewrite-guidance oriented.

## Scope notes

- `tweet-writer` is focused on X/Twitter optimization, not LinkedIn-native ranking.
- None of these skills alone guarantee virality; they provide process and quality heuristics.
