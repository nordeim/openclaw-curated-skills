# How to Get Your First 10 B2B Customers
*Source: Lenny Rachitsky's "How the biggest B2B companies got their first 10 customers"*

## The Core Finding
Lenny's research into companies like Slack, Stripe, Salesforce, and Figma reveals that B2B companies rely on just **three tactics** to get started. Marketing (ads, content, PR) almost never works for the first 10.

## Tactic 1: Personal Network (The "Warm Intro")
*Used by: Slack, Stripe, Yammer, Gusto*

This is the most common path. It is not about selling to your friends; it is about asking your friends for introductions to the right decision-makers.

*   **The Strategy:** Map your 1st and 2nd degree connections.
*   **The Pitch:** "I'm building something for [Role]. Who is the best person at your company to talk to about [Problem]?"
*   **Why it works:** B2B buyers buy on trust. A warm intro borrows trust.

## Tactic 2: Targeted Cold Outreach (The "Sniper")
*Used by: Salesforce, Box, Zoom, Segment*

If you don't have a network, you must build one. This is not "spray and pray." It is hyper-targeted.

*   **The Strategy:** Build a list of 50 perfect potential customers.
*   **The Alpha:** Do not pitch the product. Pitch an insight ("Alpha") about their business or industry.
*   **The Rule:** If the email could be sent to anyone else, it is spam. It must be specific to *them*.

## Tactic 3: Niche Communities (The "Watering Hole")
*Used by: Figma, Atlassian, Xero*

Find where your users hang out online (Subreddits, Discords, Slack groups) or offline.

*   **The Strategy:** Join the community and *add value* before selling.
*   **The Action:** Answer questions. Share resources. Be a helpful expert.
*   **The Pivot:** Once you have credibility, DM people who have the problem you solve.

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to do)
*   **Press/PR:** Useless for B2B early on.
*   **Paid Ads:** Too expensive and low conversion before you have a brand.
*   **Content Marketing:** Takes too long to kick in (6-12 months).
*   **"Launching":** Product Hunt is for consumers or prosumers, not enterprise/mid-market buyers.
