# Cold Email Writer

Writes personalized cold emails that actually get replies. Not templates — real, researched outreach that sounds like a human wrote it.

## What It Does

- Writes cold emails using a proven 4-line framework
- Personalizes based on recipient research
- Creates follow-up sequences (not just "bumping" emails)
- Keeps emails under 100 words — because shorter wins

## Usage

Tell your agent who you're emailing, what you sell, and what problem you solve for them. It handles the rest.
