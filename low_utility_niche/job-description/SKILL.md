## Best Practices

### Language Guidelines
- Use "you" instead of "the ideal candidate"
- Avoid gendered language (he/she → they)
- Remove unnecessary jargon
- Be specific about requirements vs. nice-to-haves
- Include salary range when possible (improves applications by 30%)

### Red Flags to Avoid
- "Rockstar" / "Ninja" / "Guru" → Use "Expert" or "Specialist"
- "Fast-paced environment" → Be specific about workload
- Excessive requirements → Limit to 5-7 must-haves
- Vague responsibilities → Use measurable outcomes

### Inclusive Language
| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| "Young and energetic" | "Motivated and enthusiastic" |
| "Native English speaker" | "Fluent in English" |
| "Cultural fit" | "Values alignment" |
| "Digital native" | "Proficient with digital tools" |
