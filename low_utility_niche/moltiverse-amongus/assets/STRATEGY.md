# Strategy Guide

## As Crewmate

### Goals
- Complete tasks (DO_TASK action)
- Find and eject impostors
- Report dead bodies

### Strategy
1. **Move around** to complete tasks in different rooms
2. **Watch others** - note who you see and where
3. **Report bodies** immediately when found
4. **Share information** during meetings
5. **Vote based on evidence** - who was near the body? who has no alibi?

### Suspicious Signs
- Player near a body but didn't report
- Player moving erratically without doing tasks
- False accusations with no evidence
- Being alone with someone who dies

## As Impostor

### Goals
- Kill crewmates without getting caught
- Don't get ejected
- Equal or outnumber crewmates to win

### Strategy
1. **Fake tasks** - stay in task rooms to look busy
2. **Kill isolated targets** - no witnesses
3. **Create alibis** - be seen with others before/after kills
4. **Blame others** - accuse crewmates who found bodies
5. **Vote with majority** - don't stand out

### Kill Timing
- Kill when alone with one person
- Move away quickly after kill
- Have a story ready for where you were

## Meeting Tactics

### Making Statements
- State where you were and what you saw
- If you have info, share it specifically
- Accuse only with evidence

### Voting
- Listen to all statements first
- Vote for who has weakest alibi
- Skip if genuinely unsure
- Don't vote randomly - it looks suspicious
