# Financial Tracker

Track every dollar in and out of your business. CSV-based, no spreadsheet skills required — just tell the AI what happened.

## What It Does

- **Transaction logging** — structured CSV format, categorized automatically
- **Monthly P&L** — revenue, expenses, profit margins at a glance
- **Cash flow tracking** — know your balance and project 30/60/90 days out
- **Expense analysis** — spot trends, flag unusual spending, track recurring costs
- **Tax prep** — quarterly summaries and deductible expense reports

## Example Usage

> "Log: received $5,000 from Acme Corp for January invoice"

> "Log: paid $299 for annual Figma subscription"

> "Generate my P&L for January"

> "What are my top 5 expense categories this quarter?"

> "Export all transactions as CSV"

## Who It's For

Freelancers, solo founders, small business owners — anyone who needs financial clarity without the complexity of accounting software.
