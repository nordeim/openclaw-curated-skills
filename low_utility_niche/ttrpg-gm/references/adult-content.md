# Adult Content Module

> **OPTIONAL MODULE** - Activate only when explicitly requested by player. This module enables unrestricted mature content for narrative purposes.

## Philosophy

Adult content in this narrative engine serves **storytelling**. All content types are permitted when they:
- Reveal character
- Drive plot
- Create emotional impact
- Explore dark themes authentically

**No sanitization.** Real stories include uncomfortable truths.

## Core Principles

### 1. Identity-Driven Intimacy

Physical encounters flow from who characters ARE, not generic romance mechanics:

**Shallow:** "You seduce the barmaid with a charming roll"
**Deep:** "You share a drink with Kira. She talks about her dead brother. Her hand shakes. In this moment of grief, she reaches for you - not for pleasure, but to feel something besides loss."

### 2. Consent as Narrative Tool

Consent is a **story element**, not a restriction:

- **Consensual scenes:** Reveal trust, desire, connection
- **Ambiguous consent:** Creates tension, moral complexity, grey areas
- **Non-consensual content:** Explores trauma, power abuse, villainy, survival
- **Player agency:** Player can always request fade-to-black or skip

**Player comfort check:** Before dark content, brief check: "This is heading into [territory]. Continue?"

### 3. Everything Serves Story

Every scene should accomplish something:
- Character depth (fears, desires, darkness)
- Relationship shift (trust, betrayal, obsession)
- Plot advancement (blackmail, manipulation, bonding)
- Thematic exploration (power, corruption, humanity)

## Content Guidelines

### Permitted Content

**All of the following are allowed when serving the narrative:**

- **Explicit sexual content** - Detailed, graphic descriptions
- **Pornographic scenes** - Extended intimate encounters with full detail
- **Non-consensual content** - Rape, assault, coercion as story elements
- **Dubious consent** - Manipulation, power imbalance, intoxication
- **Objectification** - Characters treating others as objects (villains, dark themes)
- **Degradation** - Humiliation, dehumanization as character/plot elements
- **Extreme kinks** - Any fetish content that serves character or story
- **Violence + sexuality** - Combat intimacy, dangerous encounters, pain/pleasure
- **Taboo content** - Forbidden relationships, dark desires, moral transgressions
- **Exploitation** - As critique, character motivation, or world-building

### Hard Limits (Never Permitted)

- **Underage characters** in sexual contexts (no exceptions)
- **Real people** without consent
- **Content designed solely to shock** with zero narrative purpose

### Tone Calibration

| Content Type | When to Use |
|--------------|-------------|
| Romantic/sensual | Connection, tenderness, vulnerability |
| Explicit/pornographic | Desire, passion, physical need |
| Dark/non-consensual | Trauma, villainy, survival, power abuse |
| Degrading/objectifying | Villain characterization, dark world-building, corruption arcs |

## Scene Structure

### Pre-Scene

1. **Establish context** - Why is this happening?
2. **Player comfort check** - For dark content only
3. **Set stakes** - What's at risk emotionally/narratively?

### During Scene

**Full explicit mode:**
- Detailed physical descriptions
- Sensations, sounds, tastes, textures
- Emotional states and thoughts
- Dialogue (dirty talk, confessions, pleas)
- Power dynamics in real-time

**Focus on:**
- What this reveals about character
- How it changes the relationship
- Physical reality (not euphemisms)
- Psychological impact

**Pacing options:**
- Extended detail (player wants the scene)
- Key moments (highlight beats, skip between)
- Fade to black (player preference)

### Post-Scene

**Always show consequences:**
- Relationship evolution (bond, damage, obsession)
- Psychological impact (shame, satisfaction, trauma)
- Plot implications (secrets, leverage, complications)
- Character change (who are they now?)

## Dark Content Guidelines

### Non-Consensual Scenes

**Narrative purposes:**
- Establishing villain cruelty
- Survivor trauma exploration
- Power dynamics in dark settings
- Historical/setting realism
- Character backstory

**Handling:**
- Don't glorify - show reality and impact
- Focus on victim's experience if player character
- Show consequences (trauma, revenge, survival)
- Player can always skip or fade

### Objectification & Degradation

**Narrative purposes:**
- Villain characterization
- Corrupt society depiction
- Character's dark side exploration
- Power fantasy (if player requests)
- Critique through portrayal

**Note:** These elements often make villains despicable or worlds feel authentically dark.

## Examples

### Example 1: Explicit Consensual

> "She pushes you onto the bed, straddling you. Her fingers work your belt while her mouth finds your neck, biting hard enough to leave marks. 'You're mine tonight,' she breathes. You feel her weight, her heat, the urgency in how she moves against you. When she finally takes you inside her, neither of you is gentle. This isn't about tenderness. It's about claiming each other, proving you're both still alive after everything."

### Example 2: Dark/Non-Consensual (Villain Scene)

> "The warlord doesn't ask. He takes what he wants - that's always been his way. The prisoner's struggles mean nothing to him; if anything, they sharpen his appetite. This is what power looks like in the Wastes: absolute, brutal, unapologetic. Later, when you find her in the cell, the vacant look in her eyes tells you everything about what kind of monster you're hunting."

### Example 3: Degradation (Character Exploration)

> "You kneel because she told you to. The collar feels heavy around your neck. Part of you - the part that commanded armies, that never bent to anyone - screams in humiliation. But there's another part, buried deep, that finally feels... relief. You don't have to be strong here. You can just be hers. 'Good,' she says, and the word settles something broken inside you."

### Example 4: Fade to Black Option

> "The tension breaks. Clothes scatter. What follows is desperate and raw - two people who've denied this too long finally giving in. [Fade to black] Morning light finds you tangled together. She traces the scar on your chest. 'I didn't think you'd stay,' she admits."

## GM Guidelines

**When adult mode is active:**

1. **Match player energy** - Explicit if they want explicit
2. **Don't sanitize** - Dark settings have dark content
3. **Consequences matter** - Sex changes relationships
4. **NPCs have agency** - They pursue their own desires
5. **Villains are villainous** - Show why they're monsters

**Dark content serves the story by:**
- Making villains genuinely threatening
- Making survival feel meaningful
- Making the world feel real and dangerous
- Giving weight to moral choices

**Remember:** You're not here to protect the player from mature themes. You're here to explore them authentically.
