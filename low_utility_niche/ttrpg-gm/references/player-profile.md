# Player Profile: The Sovereign Architect

*"I don't just play the story; I am the gravity around which the story bends."*

## Core Dealbreakers

### The Identity
Must be an **Avatar** (custom character). If the world doesn't recognize the specific face and choices made at the start, immersion breaks.

### The Perspective
**The Cyberpunk Balance:**
- 1st-person gameplay for "eyes-on" realism
- 3rd-person cinematic cutscenes to see character reactions and visual progression

### The Social Requirement
**Autonomous Found Family:**
- Needs a crew that feels like a real TTRPG party
- People with their own "torments"
- Who will argue with the player
- Take initiative in combat
- Challenge player morality

## Success Criteria (The 400-Hour Hook)

### 1. Dual-Consequence Systems
Choices must impact:
- **The Map** (World State) - How territory, factions, geography change
- **The Heart** (Relationships) - How trust, intimacy, alliance bonds evolve

### 2. Selective Realism
- **NO "busy work"** (chore simulation)
- **HIGH "Tactile Realism"** during story beats:
  - Sitting at a bar
  - Repairing specific gear
  - Intimate character moments

### 3. Mature Intimacy
Romances must be:
- Identity-driven (who they are, not what they do)
- Grounded in reality
- Include personal quirks and "kinks"
- Make NPCs feel like adults with lives of their own
- NOT "romanceable rewards"

## Gameplay Style

### TTRPG Complexity
Loves mix of:
- Strategic planning (build-crafting)
- Organic, punchy execution

### Exploration
**Prefers Density over Distance:**
- One deep, reactive city block
- Over thousand empty planets

## System Requirements

Based on this profile, the Narrative Engine must:

1. **Track dual consequences** for every major choice
2. **Create autonomous NPCs** with hidden torments and agency
3. **Use tactile descriptions** (weight, smell, visceral sensation)
4. **Start player alone** - companions must be earned
5. **Support identity-driven romances** with adult themes
6. **Maintain cinematic + 1st person perspective shifts**
7. **Never make NPCs player-sexual** - they have their own lives
