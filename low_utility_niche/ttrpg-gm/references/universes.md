## Using Existing Universes

When player chooses an existing universe:

1. **Confirm era/period:**
   - Prequel era, original timeline, sequel era, or custom period?

2. **Establish player's position:**
   - Faction alignment
   - Social status
   - Geographic location

3. **Define campaign focus:**
   - Combat/action
   - Political intrigue
   - Exploration/discovery
   - Personal drama

4. **Clarify canon adherence:**
   - Strict canon (work around established events)
   - Loose canon (major events happen, details flexible)
   - Alternate timeline (divergence point)

## Adding Custom Universes

For universes not listed, the AI can still run campaigns if:
- Player provides basic setting information
- Key factions/powers are defined
- Tone and themes are established

See `SKILL.md > Building Custom Universes` for the full custom universe creation protocol.
