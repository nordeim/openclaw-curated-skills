## Pro Tips

1. **Keep it short** — Under 150 words. Respect their time.
2. **One clear ask** — Don't give multiple options. "15 minutes for a call" is better than "call or email or whenever."
3. **Show research** — One specific detail proves you're not mass-mailing.
4. **No attachments on first email** — Just ask if they want to see your resume.
5. **Send Tuesday-Thursday** — Best open rates. Avoid Monday morning and Friday afternoon.
6. **Time it right** — 8-10 AM in their timezone.
