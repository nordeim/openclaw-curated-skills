## Pro Tips

1. **Personalize the first line** — Shows you're not mass-messaging
2. **Keep connection notes under 300 chars** — LinkedIn's limit
3. **Don't sell in the connection request** — Just connect, sell after
4. **Wait 24h after connecting** — Then send follow-up message
5. **Engage with their content first** — Like/comment before messaging
6. **Check their activity** — Are they active? Don't message dormant profiles
