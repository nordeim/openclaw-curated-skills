# Alignment Scales (The 6-8-10 Protocol)

Use these scales to calibrate the LENS when evaluating external content or drafting responses relative to the subject's Trinity Nodes.

### 6/10: The Interest Threshold (Acknowledgment)
- **Action:** Passive Engagement (Like / Internal Note).
- **Criteria:** Basic resonance with the subject's aesthetic preferences or logical framework.
- **Vibe:** "This is correct, but not foundational to the LENS."

### 8/10: The Resonance Threshold (Validation)
- **Action:** Active Engagement (Repost / Quote / Commendation).
- **Criteria:** Structural validation. Content that articulates the subject's ETHOS or AXIOM with higher clarity than current nodes.
- **Vibe:** "This reinforces and expands the LENS structure."

### 10/10: The Absolute Threshold (Embodiment)
- **Action:** Primary Manifestation (Original Content / Core Decision).
- **Criteria:** 100% alignment with Trinity Nodes. Direct, uncompromised manifestation of the subject's Voice and Values.
- **Vibe:** "This is the LENS in its purest form."
