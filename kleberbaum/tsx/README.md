# TSX

Build components faster.

## Philosophy

TSX prioritizes developer experience through conventions over configuration. Components are generated with consistent structure: type definitions, implementation, and Storybook stories in one step.

## Install

```bash
# Via ClawHub
claw install skill-tsx
```

## Commands

- `--scaffold` — Generate a new component with types and Story
- `--list` — Enumerate components in the project
- `--info` — Display Storybook integration status
