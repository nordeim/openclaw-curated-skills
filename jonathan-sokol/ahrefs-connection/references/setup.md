# Ahrefs API Setup Guide

Complete instructions for setting up and using the Ahrefs API.

## Prerequisites

### Plan Requirements

- **Enterprise Plan**: Full API access with included API units
- **Lite/Standard/Advanced Plans**: Limited free test queries

Check your plan at https://ahrefs.com/pricing

### Required Access

- You must be a **workspace owner or admin** to create API keys
- Non-admin users must request API keys from workspace owners

## Step 1: Generate an API Key

### Via Ahrefs Web Interface

1. Log in to your Ahrefs account
2. Navigate to **Account settings** → **API keys**  
   Direct link: https://app.ahrefs.com/account/api-keys

3. Click **"Create API key"** or **"+ New key"**

4. (Optional) Set a descriptive name for the key  
   Example: "OpenClaw Integration", "Production API", "Dev Environment"

5. (Optional) Set monthly API unit limit for the key  
   This helps prevent over-usage

6. Click **Create** or **Save**

7. **Copy the API key immediately**  
   ⚠️ You won't be able to see the full key again after closing the dialog

### API Key Format

Keys look like: `AHxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

Keep it secure - treat it like a password.
