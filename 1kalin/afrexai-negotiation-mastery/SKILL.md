## Phase 1: Strategic Preparation (Before You Sit Down)

### 1.1 Negotiation Brief

Fill this out BEFORE every negotiation:

```yaml

```

### 1.2 Counterpart Style Assessment

Identify their negotiation style to adapt your approach:

**Analyst (40% of negotiators)**
- Signs: Data-heavy emails, long pauses, asks for details, skeptical tone
- Approach: Send information in advance. Use silence. Provide evidence. Never rush them.
- Danger: They'll out-prepare you if you wing it.
- Key phrase: "I want to make sure we get this right."

**Assertive (25%)**
- Signs: Fast pace, interrupts, states positions firmly, competitive language
- Approach: Let them talk first. Mirror their energy (not aggression). Use calibrated questions to redirect. Respect their time.
- Danger: They'll steamroll you if you're passive.
- Key phrase: "I hear how important this is to you."

**Accommodator (20%)**
- Signs: Warm tone, relationship-focused, avoids conflict, says "yes" easily
- Approach: Build rapport first. Ask directly about concerns — they won't volunteer negatives. Verify "yes" means real agreement (not just avoiding conflict).
- Danger: Their "yes" is often "maybe." Deals can unravel post-handshake.
- Key phrase: "I want to make sure this works for both of us — what concerns do you have?"

**Connector (15%)**
- Signs: Name-drops, references other deals, builds coalitions, values status
- Approach: Acknowledge their network. Frame deals as wins they can talk about. Reference social proof.
- Danger: They may be performing consensus they don't actually have.
- Key phrase: "This would be a great story for your team."

### 1.3 Power Analysis

Rate each factor 1-5 for both sides:

| Power Source | Us | Them | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Alternatives** (BATNA strength) | | | Better alternatives = more power |
| **Information** (who knows more) | | | Knowledge of their constraints/budget |
| **Time** (who's more urgent) | | | Deadlines create pressure |
| **Legitimacy** (standards/precedent) | | | Market rates, industry norms |
| **Relationship** (ongoing value) | | | Long-term partnership leverage |
| **Commitment** (sunk costs) | | | How invested are they already |
| **Skill** (negotiation experience) | | | Experience at the table |

**Total: Us [__] vs Them [__]**

- If we're stronger: Anchor aggressively, push for value
- If balanced: Focus on creative trades, expand the pie
- If they're stronger: Improve BATNA before negotiating, use tactical empathy to equalize

---

## Phase 2: Opening & Framing

### 2.1 The Accusation Audit

List every negative thought they might have about you or this deal. Say them FIRST:

Template:
> "Before we start, I want to address some things you might be thinking. You might feel that [negative #1]. You're probably concerned that [negative #2]. And I wouldn't blame you if you thought [negative #3]. I want you to know that I understand these concerns, and here's how I'd like to address them..."

Examples by context:
- **Salary negotiation**: "You might think I'm being ungrateful or greedy for bringing this up..."
- **Vendor pricing**: "You probably feel we're just trying to squeeze your margins..."
- **Partnership**: "You might worry we're too small to deliver on this..."
- **Client scope change**: "I know it probably seems like we're moving the goalposts..."

Why it works: Naming fears diminishes them. Unspoken objections fester; spoken ones shrink.

### 2.2 Anchoring Strategy

**When to anchor first (make the first offer):**
- You have strong information about fair value
- You want to set the frame
- You're selling (anchor high) or buying something commoditized (anchor low)

**When to let them anchor first:**
- You have less information than them
- You suspect their range might be higher than yours
- You want to discover their expectations

**Anchoring formulas:**

For SELLING (salary, services, products):
1. Research market range (low–high)
2. Set your anchor at 15-30% above your target
3. Justify with specific data points
4. Never use round numbers ($127,500 not $130,000)

For BUYING (vendors, contracts, acquisitions):
1. Research market range
2. Set anchor at 60-70% of their likely ask
3. Justify with comparables
4. Include non-monetary value in your counter

### 2.3 Frame Control

The person who sets the frame controls the negotiation. Common frames:

| Frame | How to Set It | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Partnership** | "How do we make this work for both of us?" | Long-term deals |
| **Precedent** | "The standard rate for this is..." | Rate negotiations |
| **Scarcity** | "We have capacity for 2 more clients this quarter" | Sales |
| **Loss** | "Without this, the risk is..." | Upselling |
| **Fairness** | "I want to make sure this is fair for everyone" | Any negotiation |
| **Expert** | "In my experience with 50+ similar deals..." | Credibility |

---

## Phase 3: Tactical Techniques (During the Negotiation)

### 3.1 Core Techniques Reference

**Mirroring** — Repeat their last 1-3 words with rising inflection
- Purpose: Gets them to elaborate without asking a question
- Example: Them: "We just can't do that price." You: "...can't do that price?"
- Use 3-5 times per conversation. Overuse becomes obvious.

**Labeling** — Name their emotion with "It seems like..." / "It sounds like..." / "It looks like..."
- Purpose: Validates their experience, builds trust, surfaces hidden concerns
- Example: "It sounds like timeline is really what's driving this decision."
- Follow with silence. Let the label do its work.
- Never say "I understand" — it's about THEM, not you.

**Calibrated Questions** — "How" and "What" questions that give them the illusion of control
- Purpose: Makes them solve YOUR problem
- Power questions:
  - "How am I supposed to do that?" (gentle pushback on unreasonable asks)
  - "What does success look like for you?"
  - "How does this fit within your budget process?"
  - "What's the biggest challenge you're facing with this?"
  - "How would you like me to proceed?"
  - "What happens if we don't reach an agreement?"
  - "How can I make this work within your constraints?"
  - "What would you need to see to move forward?"

**Tactical Silence** — Pause 4-7 seconds after making a point or asking a question
- Purpose: Creates discomfort that the other side fills (usually with concessions or information)
- Hardest technique to master. Practice counting silently to 5.

**Late-Night FM DJ Voice** — Slow, calm, downward-inflecting tone
- Purpose: Signals confidence and control. Calms heated moments.
- Use for: Delivering tough messages, anchoring, de-escalation
- Never use for: Building rapport (too cold), brainstorming (kills energy)

### 3.2 The "That's Right" Method

Most powerful two words in negotiation. Getting "That's right" means genuine buy-in (unlike "you're right" which is dismissive).

Steps to trigger it:
1. Listen actively to their full position
2. Paraphrase their situation comprehensively
3. Label the emotions behind their words
4. Summarize: "So what you're saying is [their world, their constraints, their feelings]..."
5. Wait for "That's right."

Only propose solutions AFTER you get "That's right."

### 3.3 Saying "No" Without Saying No

Never say "No" directly. Use graduated responses:

1. **"How am I supposed to do that?"** (gentlest — makes them rethink)
2. **"I'd love to but I'm unable to do that."** (firm but warm)
3. **"I'm sorry, that just doesn't work for us."** (definitive)
4. **"I'm sorry, no."** (nuclear — use only when walking away)

### 3.4 Concession Strategy

**The Ackerman Method** (for price negotiations):
1. Set target price
2. First offer: 65% of target
3. Second: 85% of target
4. Third: 95% of target
5. Final: 100% — use precise number ($47,823 not $48,000) + add non-monetary item

**Concession rules:**
- Never make the first concession on price (trade something else first)
- Every concession must get something in return ("If I can do X, would you be able to do Y?")
- Concessions should decrease in size (signals you're approaching your limit)
- Never concede on your own — always tie it to their move
- Log every concession in real time:

```yaml
concession_log:
  - round: 1
    we_gave: "[What we conceded]"
    we_got: "[What they conceded]"
    their_reaction: "[How they responded]"
    next_move: "[Our planned next step]"
```

### 3.5 Handling Deadlocks

When negotiations stall:

1. **Change the shape** — Add variables (timeline, scope, payment terms, exclusivity)
2. **Go to the balcony** — "Let me think about this and come back to you" (breaks emotional escalation)
3. **Use a hypothetical** — "What if we could [creative solution]? Would that change things?"
4. **Bring in a Black Swan** — Reveal new information strategically
5. **Change the people** — Suggest involving someone else ("Would it help to bring in [person]?")
6. **Re-anchor on interests** — "Let's step back. What are we both trying to achieve here?"
7. **Strategic walk-away** — "I don't think we can make this work. I appreciate your time." (Often gets a callback)

## Phase 4: Scenario Playbooks

### 4.1 Salary Negotiation

**Preparation:**
- Research: Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, LinkedIn salary insights, industry reports
- Calculate your market value range (P25-P75)
- List 3-5 concrete achievements with $ impact
- Know your BATNA (other offers, current job value)

**Script:**
1. "I'm really excited about this role and want to make this work." (frame: partnership)
2. "Based on my research and the value I bring, I was thinking in the range of $[anchor — 15-20% above target]."
3. If they counter low: "I appreciate that. Help me understand — how did you arrive at that number?"
4. "What I bring specifically is [achievement 1: saved $X], [achievement 2: grew Y by Z%], and [achievement 3]."
5. If stuck: "Is salary the only lever, or can we look at [equity, bonus, title, remote days, signing bonus, review timeline]?"

**Never say:** "I need $X because of my expenses/mortgage/etc." (irrelevant to them)

### 4.2 Vendor/Contract Negotiation

**Preparation:**
- Get 3+ competing quotes (real BATNA)
- Research their margins, competitors, and contract terms
- Identify their fiscal year-end (budget pressure)

**Script:**
1. "We really like your product and want to make this work." (genuine interest)
2. "We've received competitive proposals at [lower number]. What can you do?"
3. If they hold: "What would a 2-year commitment look like?" (trade commitment for discount)
4. "Can we structure payment terms differently? [Quarterly vs annual, net-60 vs net-30]"
5. Always negotiate: implementation fees, support tier, training, SLA, auto-renewal removal, price lock period

### 4.3 Client Deal Negotiation

**Preparation:**
- Quantify the value you deliver (ROI, time saved, revenue generated)
- Know their budget cycle and decision process
- Map all stakeholders and their interests

**Script:**
1. Lead with value: "Based on what you've shared, this should [save/generate] approximately $[X] annually."
2. Present three-tier pricing (the middle one is your target — decoy effect)
3. If they push on price: "I want to make sure you get the outcome you need. If we reduce scope to [X], we could come in at [Y]. Would that work?"
4. Never discount without removing scope. Ever. Price = value.
5. "What would need to be true for you to move forward this week?"

### 4.4 Partnership/Equity Negotiation

**Key principles:**
- Everything is negotiable: vesting, cliffs, acceleration, roles, decision rights
- Get it in writing before anyone does work
- Negotiate control (voting, board seats) separately from economics (equity %)

**Topics to cover:**
1. Equity split and vesting schedule (standard: 4yr vest, 1yr cliff)
2. Decision-making process (unanimous? majority? domain-specific?)
3. What happens if someone leaves (buyback, drag-along, tag-along)
4. Cash vs equity compensation for each partner
5. IP assignment (everything created belongs to the company)
6. Non-compete and non-solicit terms
7. Exit scenarios (sale, IPO, dissolution)

## Phase 5: Reading the Room

### 5.1 Body Language Signals (In-Person/Video)

| Signal | Likely Meaning | Your Move |
|---|---|---|
| Leaning forward | Engaged, interested | Keep going, make your ask |
| Arms crossed + leaning back | Defensive or skeptical | Label: "It seems like something about that doesn't sit right" |
| Looking at watch/phone | Losing interest or time pressure | Speed up or offer a break |
| Nodding slowly | Processing, somewhat agreeing | Pause. Let them speak. |
| Rapid nodding | Wants you to stop talking | Stop. Ask: "What are your thoughts?" |
| Steepled fingers | Feeling confident/superior | They think they have leverage. Probe: "What am I missing?" |
| Touching face/neck | Discomfort or uncertainty | Label the emotion. Slow down. |
| Mirroring YOUR posture | Rapport established | Good sign — proceed to closing |

### 5.2 Verbal Tells

| They Say | They Mean | Your Move |
|---|---|---|
| "That's not in our budget" | "Not in THIS budget, but maybe another" | "What budget would this come from?" |
| "We need to think about it" | Objection they won't voice | "What specifically do you need to think through?" |
| "We're talking to others too" | Leverage play (may be true) | "Of course. What would make us the clear choice?" |
| "That's fair" | Possible warning — check if genuine | "I want to make sure it actually IS fair. What concerns do you have?" |
| "My hands are tied" | Someone else has authority | "Who else would need to be involved to make this work?" |
| "We usually pay X" | Anchoring with precedent | "Help me understand — what was the scope of that engagement?" |
| "Can you do better?" | Lazy negotiating — testing you | "Better in what way? Help me understand what you need." |
| "Final offer" | Probably not final (especially first time) | Stay calm. "I appreciate you being direct. Let me ask — [calibrated question]" |

### 5.3 Email/Async Negotiation Rules

- Don't negotiate price over email if possible (call or meet)
- If you must: be brief, use precise numbers, end with a question
- Response timing matters: too fast = eager, too slow = disinterested. 4-24 hours is ideal.
- Never write anything you wouldn't want forwarded (assume it will be)
- Put your best offer in writing only when you're confident they'll accept

---

## Phase 6: Closing & Post-Negotiation

### 6.1 Closing Techniques

**The Rule of Three** — Confirm agreement 3 times in 3 different ways:
1. Direct: "So we're agreed on $X with Y terms?"
2. Summary: "Let me make sure I have this right: [full summary]"
3. Implementation: "Great. How should we handle the paperwork?"

**Implementation questions** (most important step — deals die in execution):
- "What does the approval process look like on your side?"
- "Who else needs to sign off?"
- "What timeline are we looking at for getting this finalized?"
- "What could prevent this from moving forward?"

### 6.2 Post-Negotiation Review

Fill this out after EVERY significant negotiation:

```yaml
negotiation_review:
  date: "[YYYY-MM-DD]"
  counterpart: "[Who]"
  context: "[What was negotiated]"
  
  outcome:
    result: "" # win|lose|partial|no-deal
    our_target: "[What we wanted]"
    actual_result: "[What we got]"
    satisfaction: "" # 1-10
    relationship_impact: "" # strengthened|neutral|strained
  
  what_worked:
    - "[Technique or approach that was effective]"
  
  what_didnt:
    - "[Where we lost ground or made mistakes]"
  
  lessons:
    - "[Key takeaway for next time]"
  
  black_swans_discovered:
    - "[Hidden information that emerged]"
  
  follow_up_actions:
    - action: "[What needs to happen next]"
      owner: "[Who]"
      deadline: "[When]"
```

### 6.3 The 48-Hour Rule

Within 48 hours of reaching agreement:
1. Send written summary of all terms (email)
2. Confirm next steps and timeline
3. Thank them genuinely (builds long-term relationship)
4. Make first implementation move (momentum kills deal decay)

---

## Phase 7: Advanced Techniques

### 7.1 Multi-Party Negotiations

When more than 2 parties are involved:
- Map every stakeholder's interests SEPARATELY
- Build coalitions before the main negotiation
- Identify the "swing vote" — who is undecided?
- Use bilateral pre-meetings to align positions
- In the room: address the most skeptical person's concerns first

### 7.2 Cross-Cultural Considerations

| Culture Type | Approach | Watch For |
|---|---|---|
| **Direct** (US, Germany, Israel, Netherlands) | State positions clearly, expect pushback | Don't mistake bluntness for hostility |
| **Indirect** (Japan, Korea, Thailand, much of LATAM) | Read between lines, proposals in writing, patience | "Yes" may mean "I heard you" not "I agree" |
| **Relationship-first** (Middle East, China, parts of Africa) | Invest in dinners, trust-building, long timelines | Rushing to terms = insult |
| **Contract-first** (US, UK, Australia) | Get to specifics quickly, lawyers early | Over-reliance on paper; trust matters too |

### 7.3 Negotiating Under Pressure

When you're in a weak position:
1. **Improve your BATNA first** — Don't negotiate until you have alternatives
2. **Slow everything down** — Pressure thrives on speed
3. **Ask more questions** — Information is power
4. **Unbundle the deal** — Negotiate each element separately
5. **Introduce new variables** — More items = more trading opportunities
6. **Use objective criteria** — Market data, benchmarks, industry standards
7. **Strategic vulnerability** — "I'll be honest, we need this to work. Here's why it's worth making it work for you too."

### 7.4 Negotiating with Difficult People

**The Bully** — Aggressive, intimidating, threatens
- Stay calm. Mirror their words (not energy). "It seems like you feel strongly about this."
- Never match aggression. Silence is your weapon.
- "I want to find a solution. Help me understand what you need."

**The Ghost** — Stops responding, avoids commitment
- "Have you given up on this project?" (triggers "No" response)
- Set deadlines: "I can hold this offer until [date]. After that, my availability changes."
- Go around: find another contact at their organization.

**The Nibbler** — Agrees, then asks for "one more thing" repeatedly
- "I'm happy to discuss that. What would you be willing to adjust from what we've already agreed?"
- Every nibble gets a counter-nibble.

**The Authority Excuse** — "I need to check with my boss"
- Ask upfront: "Who else is involved in this decision?"
- "When you check with them, what do you think they'll focus on?"
- Offer to present to the decision-maker directly.

## Quick-Reference: Negotiation Scoring Rubric

Score your preparation and performance (0-100):

| Dimension | Weight | Score (0-10) |
|---|---|---|
| **Preparation** (research, BATNA, interests mapped) | 25% | |
| **Opening** (frame, anchor, accusation audit) | 15% | |
| **Information gathering** (questions, listening, discovery) | 20% | |
| **Value creation** (expanded pie, creative trades) | 15% | |
| **Tactical execution** (techniques, concession management) | 15% | |
| **Closing** (commitment, implementation, follow-up) | 10% | |

**Weighted total: [__] / 100**

- 80+: Expert negotiation
- 60-79: Solid performance
- 40-59: Adequate — review what was missed
- Below 40: Significant preparation or technique gaps

---

## Common Mistakes (Avoid These)

1. **Negotiating against yourself** — Making concessions before they even push back
2. **Splitting the difference** — Lazy compromise leaves value on the table
3. **Accepting the first offer** — There's ALWAYS room to negotiate
4. **Negotiating only on price** — Scope, timeline, terms, support, payment structure are all levers
5. **Talking too much** — The more you talk, the more you reveal. Listen 70%, talk 30%.
6. **Taking it personally** — It's business. Separate the people from the problem.
7. **No BATNA** — Negotiating without alternatives = negotiating from weakness
8. **Winging it** — The best negotiators prepare more, not less
9. **Ignoring implementation** — A deal on paper means nothing if execution isn't planned
10. **Burning bridges** — Today's opponent is tomorrow's partner. Always leave gracefully.
