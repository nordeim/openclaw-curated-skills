# Sales ROI Calculator

Drop-in ROI analysis for any business investment. Your agent calculates net returns, payback period, and risk-adjusted scenarios in seconds.

## Why This Exists

Every purchase decision boils down to one question: "Is this worth it?" This skill gives your agent the framework to answer that with actual numbers instead of gut feelings.

## What You Get

- **Three-scenario analysis** — conservative, moderate, aggressive projections
- **Payback period** — exactly when the investment breaks even
- **GO / CONDITIONAL / PASS** verdict based on hard thresholds
- **AI automation multipliers** — specialized logic for automation ROI

## Example

> "Should we spend $2,000/month on a marketing tool that generates 15 leads/month?"

Your agent runs the numbers: lead value, conversion rate, pipeline impact — and tells you whether it's a GO or a PASS.

## Works With

Any AI agent platform. Just install and ask your agent to calculate ROI on anything.
