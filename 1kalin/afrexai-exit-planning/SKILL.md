### 5. Deal Structure Decoder

**Common structures and what they mean for sellers:**

| Structure | Seller Risk | Tax Impact | When Used |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| All Cash | Lowest | Immediate gain | Strong seller position |
| Cash + Earnout | Medium | Deferred gain | Revenue validation needed |
| Cash + Seller Note | Medium | Installment sale | Buyer financing gap |
| Equity Rollover | Highest | Tax-deferred | PE recaps, strategic mergers |
| Asset Sale | Varies | Ordinary income risk | Liability protection for buyer |
| Stock Sale | Varies | Capital gains | Simpler, seller-preferred |

**Earnout Red Flags:**
- More than 30% of total value in earnout = risky
- Earnout period >2 years = too long
- Metrics you can't control post-close = avoid
- No accounting standard specified = dispute guaranteed
- Buyer can make decisions that tank your earnout = walk away

### 6. Tax Optimization Strategies

**US Sellers:**
- QSBS exclusion: up to $10M or 10x basis tax-free (Section 1202)
- Installment sale: spread gain over payment period
- Opportunity Zone reinvestment: defer and reduce gains
- Charitable remainder trust: donate appreciated stock pre-sale
- ESOP sale: 1042 rollover for C-corp shareholders

**UK Sellers:**
- Business Asset Disposal Relief (BADR): 10% rate on first £1M
- EIS/SEIS reinvestment relief
- Holdover relief for gift of business assets
- Entrepreneurs' Relief planning (lifetime limit)

### 7. Post-Exit Transition Plan

**Founder Transition (typical terms):**
- 6-month transition: light involvement, knowledge transfer
- 12-month transition: part-time advisory, customer introductions
- 24-month transition: full operational handover (PE-backed deals)
- Non-compete: usually 2-3 years, geographic + industry scope

**What to negotiate before signing:**
- Transition compensation (salary + benefits continue)
- Acceleration of remaining equity/earnout on termination
- Scope of non-compete (narrower = better for you)
- Ability to invest in non-competing businesses
- Personal brand rights (can you still speak, write, consult?)

## Industry Exit Benchmarks

| Industry | Median Multiple | Median Deal Size | Avg Time to Close |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| B2B SaaS | 7.2x ARR | $28M | 6-9 months |
| IT Services | 1.8x revenue | $12M | 4-6 months |
| Healthcare IT | 5.5x ARR | $35M | 8-12 months |
| Ecommerce | 4.1x SDE | $2.5M | 3-5 months |

## Common Exit Killers

1. **Customer concentration** — One client >25% of revenue scares every buyer
2. **Founder dependency** — If you ARE the business, it's worth less without you
3. **Messy financials** — Commingled expenses, no monthly close, no forecasting
4. **Key person risk** — Critical employees with no contracts or retention plan
5. **Revenue quality** — One-time revenue dressed up as recurring
6. **Undisclosed liabilities** — Tax issues, pending claims, contract breaches
7. **Unrealistic expectations** — Pricing based on 2021 multiples, not 2026 reality
