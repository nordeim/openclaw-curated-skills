# Grant Writer — AI-Powered Grant Proposal Generator

Write winning grant proposals without hiring a $150/hr consultant.

This skill turns your AI agent into a grant-writing specialist that produces submission-ready applications for government, foundation, and corporate funding programs.

## What You Get

- **Complete proposals** — cover letter through budget justification, every section
- **Funder-matched language** — mirrors the grant program's priorities and terminology
- **SMART objectives** — no vague fluff, every goal is measurable
- **Budget narratives** — line-item justification that reviewers actually approve
- **Scoring self-check** — rates your draft against typical evaluation rubrics

## Supported Grant Types

- **Government**: SBIR/STTR, Innovate UK, Horizon Europe, NSF, NIH, USDA
- **Foundation**: Ford, Gates, MacArthur, Wellcome Trust, local community foundations
- **Corporate**: Google.org, Microsoft AI for Good, AWS Credits, Salesforce.org

## Quick Start

Install and tell your agent what you're applying for:

> "Write a grant proposal for Innovate UK Smart Grant. We're a 12-person AI company building document automation for legal firms. Asking for £250K over 18 months."

The agent handles the rest — research, structure, drafting, and self-review.

## Why This Exists

Grant writing is a $2B industry because the process is painful. Most small teams either can't afford a grant writer or spend 80+ hours on applications that don't score well.

This skill encodes the frameworks that professional grant writers use — funder alignment, logic models, SMART objectives, budget justification patterns — so your agent produces reviewer-ready output on the first pass.
