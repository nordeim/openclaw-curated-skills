# Budget Planner 💰

Turn your AI agent into a budget tracker. Create budgets, log spending, get variance reports, and catch overspending before it becomes a problem.

Works for personal finance, project budgets, or department-level tracking.

## Features
- **Structured budgets** with categories and allocations
- **Spending tracking** with simple natural language ("spent $45 on food")
- **Variance analysis** — see where you're over/under at a glance
- **Threshold alerts** — warnings at 80%, flags when over
- **Monthly reports** with trend analysis

## Install
```
clawhub install afrexai-budget-planner
```

## Quick Start
1. "Create a monthly budget for $3,000"
2. "Log $1,500 for rent"
3. "How's my budget looking?"

That's it. Your agent handles the tracking, math, and reporting.
