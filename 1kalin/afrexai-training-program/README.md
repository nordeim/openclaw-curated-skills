# Employee Training Program Builder

Build structured, measurable training programs for any role or compliance requirement. From onboarding to leadership development to SOC 2 certification prep.

## What It Does

- Generates complete training curricula with modules, assessments, and timelines
- Creates competency rubrics and completion tracking tables
- Handles compliance training (HIPAA, GDPR, OSHA, SOC 2) with recertification schedules
- Calculates training ROI with real metrics

## Use Cases

- **New hire onboarding**: Role-specific 30/60/90 day programs
- **Compliance**: Annual certifications with audit trails
- **Upskilling**: Tool rollouts, process changes, new tech adoption
- **Leadership**: Management training paths with competency frameworks

## Quick Start

Ask your agent:
- "Build a 2-week onboarding program for junior developers"
- "Create HIPAA compliance training for our healthcare team"
- "Design a leadership development program for new managers"

## Why Training Programs Matter

Companies investing in employee training see 24% higher profit margins (ATD). 94% of employees stay longer when companies invest in their development. Yet 59% of workers say they had no formal training.

The gap between "we should train people" and actually doing it? A structured program. This skill builds that structure.
