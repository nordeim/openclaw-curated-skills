# AfrexAI DevOps & Platform Engineering Engine

Complete DevOps lifecycle in one agent skill — CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, container orchestration, Kubernetes operations, observability, incident response, SRE practices, security hardening, and cloud cost optimization.

## Why This Exists

Most DevOps skills cover one slice — a CI template here, a Dockerfile tip there. This covers the **entire production software lifecycle** in one comprehensive system.

What you get:
- **11 phases** from repo strategy to cost optimization
- **Decision matrices** for every major choice (deployment strategy, IaC tool, CI platform, secrets management)
- **Production-ready templates** — Kubernetes manifests, Terraform structure, Docker multi-stage builds, alerting rules
- **SRE frameworks** — SLOs, error budgets, toil reduction, capacity planning
- **Incident response** — severity levels, workflow, post-mortem template, on-call best practices
- **Security** — full CI security pipeline, network hardening baseline, secrets management guide
- **DevOps maturity assessment** — score your team across 6 dimensions

## Install

```bash
clawhub install afrexai-devops-engine
```

## Quick Start

Tell your agent:
- "Set up CI/CD for my Node.js project"
- "Create a production Dockerfile for my Python API"
- "Write Terraform for ECS + RDS"
- "Design alerting rules for my checkout service"
- "Help me write a post-mortem"
- "Assess our DevOps maturity"

## What's Inside

| Phase | Covers |
|-------|--------|
| Repository Strategy | Git flow decisions, branch protection, commit conventions |
| CI/CD Pipelines | Universal template, platform cheat sheet, caching, GitHub Actions patterns |
| Containers | Multi-stage Dockerfile, image security, docker-compose for dev |
| Infrastructure as Code | Terraform structure, safety rules, environment promotion |
| Kubernetes | Deployment templates, HPA, Helm checklist, kubectl cheat sheet |
| Deployment Strategies | Rolling vs blue-green vs canary decision matrix, rollback checklist |
