# OKR Framework — Objectives & Key Results Planner

Build quarterly OKRs that actually drive outcomes. Not vague aspirations — measurable targets with scoring, alignment checks, and review cadences.

## What This Does

When triggered, walk the user through structured OKR planning:

1. **Company-level objectives** — 3-5 per quarter max
2. **Team-level alignment** — cascade from company, don't duplicate
3. **Individual OKRs** — tied to team objectives, owned by one person
4. **Scoring & grading** — 0.0-1.0 scale with calibration guidelines
5. **Review cadence** — weekly check-ins, monthly scoring, quarterly retrospective

## How to Use

Say: "Help me set OKRs for Q2" or "Create OKRs for my engineering team" or "Review last quarter's OKR scores"

## OKR Writing Rules

### Objectives
- Start with a verb (Launch, Increase, Reduce, Build, Establish)
- Qualitative and inspiring — the "what" and "why"
- Time-bound to the quarter
- Max 5 per level (company/team/individual)

### Key Results
- Quantitative and measurable — the "how much"
- 2-4 per objective
- Must have a number: percentage, count, dollar amount, date
- Graded 0.0-1.0 where 0.7 = target (stretch goals should hit 0.6-0.7)

### Bad vs Good Examples

❌ "Improve customer satisfaction"
✅ "Increase NPS from 32 to 50 by end of Q2"

❌ "Grow revenue"
✅ "Close $450K in new ARR from enterprise segment (>$50K ACV)"

❌ "Ship faster"
✅ "Reduce average cycle time from 14 days to 7 days for P1 features"

## Scoring Guide

| Score | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 0.0-0.3 | Failed to make meaningful progress | Post-mortem required — was it wrong goal or wrong execution? |
| 0.4-0.6 | Made progress but fell short | Identify blockers. Carry forward or adjust target? |
| 0.7 | Hit target | This is the sweet spot. Means goals were ambitious but achievable |
| 0.8-1.0 | Exceeded target | Either crushed it or goal wasn't ambitious enough. Calibrate next quarter |

## Alignment Check

For every team OKR, answer:
1. Which company objective does this support?
2. If this team hits all its KRs, does the company objective move?
3. Is any company objective orphaned (no team OKR supports it)?

## Quarterly Review Template

```
## Q[X] 20XX OKR Retrospective

### Company Objectives
| # | Objective | Score | Status |
|---|-----------|-------|--------|
| 1 | [objective] | [0.0-1.0] | 🟢/🟡/🔴 |

### What Worked
- [specific wins]

### What Didn't
- [specific misses with root cause]

### Carry Forward to Q[X+1]
- [objectives/KRs that need continuation]

### Kill List
- [OKRs that are no longer relevant — delete, don't carry dead weight]
```

## AI Agent OKR Patterns (Feb 2026)

Satisfi Labs just launched OKR-based AI agent performance tracking. The pattern is clear: treat AI agents like employees with measurable objectives.

**Agent OKR examples:**
- O: Reduce manual customer support workload → KR: Handle 60% of Tier 1 tickets autonomously
- O: Accelerate sales pipeline → KR: Qualify 200 inbound leads per month with 85%+ accuracy
- O: Improve financial close speed → KR: Automate 80% of invoice matching, reduce close from 10 days to 4

## CFR Companion (Conversations, Feedback, Recognition)

OKRs work best with ongoing CFRs — not annual reviews:
- **Weekly 1:1s**: 15 min, focus on blockers and priorities
- **Monthly feedback**: Specific, behavioral, forward-looking
- **Quarterly recognition**: Tied to KR achievement, public where appropriate

## Industry OKR Templates

### SaaS
- O: Achieve product-market fit → KR: 40% of trial users convert to paid within 14 days
- O: Scale revenue engine → KR: Grow MRR from $50K to $120K

### Professional Services
- O: Improve delivery margins → KR: Increase average project margin from 35% to 45%
- O: Build repeatable offerings → KR: Launch 3 productized service packages

### Healthcare
- O: Improve patient outcomes → KR: Reduce average diagnosis-to-treatment time by 30%
- O: Ensure compliance → KR: Pass 100% of quarterly HIPAA audits with zero findings

### Manufacturing
- O: Optimize production efficiency → KR: Increase OEE from 72% to 85%
- O: Reduce quality defects → KR: Achieve <0.5% defect rate across all product lines

### Fintech
- O: Accelerate transaction processing → KR: Reduce settlement time from T+2 to T+0
- O: Strengthen risk management → KR: Reduce false positive fraud alerts by 40%
