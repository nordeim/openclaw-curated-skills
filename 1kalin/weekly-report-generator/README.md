# Weekly Report Generator

Stop spending Friday afternoons writing reports. Generate structured, insight-driven weekly reports in minutes.

## What It Does

- **Executive reports** — TL;DR, KPIs, wins, blockers, and next steps
- **Team reports** — capacity, completed work, blockers, and shoutouts
- **Sales reports** — revenue, pipeline, activity metrics, and forecast
- **Marketing reports** — campaigns, leads, content, and budget tracking
- **Project status** — RAG status, milestones, budget, and action items

## Example Usage

> "Generate my weekly executive report. Wins: landed Acme deal ($120K), shipped v2.1. Blockers: hiring still slow. KPIs: MRR $45K (+8%), churn 2.1%"

> "Create a team report for my engineering squad this week"

> "Write a sales weekly — we closed 3 deals, lost 1, added 7 to pipeline"

## Who It's For

Managers, founders, team leads — anyone who reports up, across, or to stakeholders weekly and wants to save 1-2 hours every Friday.
