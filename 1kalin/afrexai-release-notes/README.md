# Release Notes Generator

Stop writing release notes by hand. Paste your git log, PR titles, or plain English — get formatted, user-friendly changelogs in seconds.

## What It Does

- Turns raw commits into structured release notes
- Groups by type (Added, Fixed, Breaking Changes, etc.)
- Follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format
- Outputs for GitHub, email, Slack, or customer-facing docs
- Includes migration guides for breaking changes automatically

## Quick Start

Install in OpenClaw, then:

> "Here are the commits since v2.1.0 — generate release notes for our customers"

Or:

> "We shipped dark mode, fixed the payments bug, and deprecated the v1 API. Write release notes."

## Who It's For

- Engineering teams tired of writing changelogs manually
- Product managers who need customer-facing release comms
- DevOps teams adding changelog steps to CI/CD

## Output Formats

- CHANGELOG.md (append-ready)
- GitHub Release page
