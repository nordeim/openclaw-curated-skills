# QA Test Plan Generator

Generate complete test plans, coverage matrices, automation ROI calculations, and release readiness checklists for your engineering team.

## What It Does

- **Test coverage matrices** — Unit, integration, E2E, performance, security targets by module
- **Test case generation** — Prioritized cases with edge cases, error paths, and boundary conditions
- **Bug severity framework** — S1-S4 classification with SLA targets
- **Automation ROI calculator** — Break-even analysis for test automation investment
- **Release readiness checklists** — Go/no-go criteria with pass rate thresholds
- **QA metrics dashboard** — Coverage, flaky rate, escaped defects, pipeline speed

## The Problem

Engineering teams spend 23% of sprint time fixing bugs instead of shipping features. Bugs caught in production cost 30x more than bugs caught in development. Most teams lack a structured QA process — they test ad hoc and hope for the best.

## Who It's For

- Engineering managers building QA processes from scratch
- QA leads standardizing across teams
- CTOs evaluating test automation investment
- Startups scaling from "move fast and break things" to "move fast and don't break things"

## Example Prompt

> "Generate a test plan for our payment processing module. Stack: React + Node.js + PostgreSQL. 8 engineers, weekly releases. Need SOC 2 compliance. Current coverage: ~45%."
