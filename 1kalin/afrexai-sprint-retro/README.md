# Sprint Retrospective Facilitator

Run structured sprint retrospectives that produce real action items — not vague commitments nobody follows up on.

Supports 5 frameworks (Start/Stop/Continue, 4Ls, Mad/Sad/Glad, Sailboat, DAKI), tracks patterns across sprints, and generates reports with owned action items.

## Quick Start

Install via ClawHub, then tell your agent:
- `Run a retrospective for Sprint 24`
- `Quick retro: [paste feedback]`
- `Compare last 3 retros`

## Why This Exists

Most retros produce a wall of sticky notes and zero follow-through. This skill forces structured output: every action item gets an owner, a deadline, and success criteria. It also compares across sprints so recurring problems can't hide.

## Who It's For

Engineering leads, scrum masters, product managers, agency teams — anyone running sprints who's tired of retros that don't change anything.
