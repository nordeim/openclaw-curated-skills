# AfrexAI OKR & Goal Alignment Engine

Complete Objectives and Key Results system — from company vision to individual weekly priorities.

## What This Does

- Guides you through writing objectives that actually inspire (not corporate jargon)
- Structures key results with baselines, targets, and scoring
- Cascades goals from company → department → team → individual
- Weekly execution system that keeps OKRs alive (not set-and-forget)
- Mid-quarter course correction framework
- End-of-quarter scoring and retrospective
- 100-point quality rubric to catch bad OKRs before committing
- Templates for every company stage (startup → enterprise)
- Department-specific examples (engineering, sales, marketing, CS)

## Install

```bash
clawhub install afrexai-okr-engine
```

## Quick Start

Tell your agent:
- "Set company OKRs for Q2"
- "Cascade this objective to my engineering team"
- "Score our OKRs — are they good enough?"
- "Weekly check-in for the product team"

## What Makes This Different

Most OKR resources give you the theory. This gives you:
- **Fill-in YAML templates** for every phase
- **Scoring rubrics** so you know if your OKRs are actually good
- **Anti-pattern diagnosis** — the 12 ways OKRs fail and how to fix each
- **Stage-appropriate templates** — pre-PMF startup ≠ 500-person company
- **Execution bridge** — how OKRs connect to what you do on Monday morning

Zero dependencies. Pure methodology. Works with any agent.
