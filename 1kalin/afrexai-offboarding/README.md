# Employee Offboarding Manager

Stop losing institutional knowledge and leaving security gaps when people leave.

This skill generates complete, role-specific offboarding packages: IT access revocation, knowledge transfer plans, HR compliance checklists, and manager transition timelines.

**No more "did anyone revoke their AWS access?" three months later.**

## What You Get

- IT & access revocation checklist (SaaS, cloud, physical)
- Knowledge transfer plan with handover schedule
- HR & compliance checklist (payroll, benefits, legal)
- Manager transition plan with interim coverage
- Day-by-day timeline from notice to departure

clawhub install afrexai-offboarding
