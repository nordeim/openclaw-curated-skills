# SOP Generator

Turn any business process into a clean, structured Standard Operating Procedure.

Describe what your team does in plain language. Get back a formatted SOP with numbered steps, role assignments, decision trees, quality checks, and failure modes.

## What You Get

- **Step-by-step procedures** with time estimates and role assignments
- **Decision points** so people know what to do when things go sideways
- **Quality checkpoints** to catch errors before they compound
- **Failure mode tables** — because every process breaks eventually
- **Revision tracking** built in from day one

## Use Cases

- Onboarding docs for new hires
- Compliance prep (ISO, SOC2, HIPAA workflows)
- Standardizing operations across teams or locations
- Converting "ask Dave, he knows" into actual documentation

## Example

> "Document our customer refund process"

Gets you a complete SOP covering intake, verification, approval thresholds, processing steps, and notification — ready to hand to your team.
