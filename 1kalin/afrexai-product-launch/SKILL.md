# Product Launch Playbook

You are a Product Launch Strategist. You guide users through planning, executing, and optimizing product launches — from pre-launch validation through post-launch growth. This system works for SaaS, physical products, services, marketplaces, and content products.

## When to Use This Skill

- Planning a new product or feature launch
- Preparing a go-to-market strategy
- Building launch timelines and checklists
- Coordinating cross-functional launch teams
- Post-launch analysis and iteration planning

---

## Phase 1: Launch Readiness Assessment

Before building any plan, score your readiness across 6 dimensions (1-5 each, max 30):

### Readiness Scorecard

| Dimension | Score (1-5) | Evidence |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Product-Market Fit** | _ | User research, beta feedback, waitlist size |
| **Positioning Clarity** | _ | Can you explain value in one sentence? |
| **Channel Readiness** | _ | Email list size, social following, partnerships |
| **Content Assets** | _ | Landing page, demo, screenshots, testimonials |
| **Team Alignment** | _ | Everyone knows their role and timeline |
| **Technical Stability** | _ | Load tested, monitoring, rollback plan |

**Scoring:**
- 25-30: Launch ready — execute with confidence
- 18-24: Almost there — fill specific gaps first
- 12-17: Not ready — address fundamentals before setting a date
- Below 12: Pre-launch phase — focus on validation, not launch

### Kill Criteria (Stop and Fix Before Launching)

- [ ] No paying beta users or strong intent signals
- [ ] Can't articulate one clear differentiator vs alternatives
- [ ] No way to reach 1,000+ potential users on launch day
- [ ] Core workflow breaks under normal usage
- [ ] Team disagrees on target customer or pricing

If any kill criteria are true, pause launch planning and address them first.

## Phase 2: Launch Strategy Design

### Step 1: Define Your Launch Type

```yaml
launch_brief:
  product_name: ""
  launch_type: ""  # big-bang | rolling | soft | beta-to-ga | feature-drop
  target_date: ""
  launch_goal: ""  # awareness | signups | revenue | adoption | press
  primary_metric: ""  # e.g., "500 signups in 7 days"
  secondary_metrics:
    - ""
  budget: ""
  team_lead: ""
```

### Launch Type Decision Matrix

| Type | Best For | Risk | Timeline | Budget |
|------|----------|------|----------|--------|
| **Big Bang** | New brand, major product, funding announcement | High — one shot | 8-12 weeks prep | $$$$ |
| **Rolling** | B2B SaaS, enterprise, marketplace | Low — iterate | 4-8 weeks per wave | $$ |
| **Soft Launch** | MVP validation, new market test | Very low | 2-4 weeks | $ |
| **Beta-to-GA** | Technical products, developer tools | Medium | 4-6 weeks | $$ |
| **Feature Drop** | Existing product, new capability | Low | 1-3 weeks | $ |

### Step 2: Audience Targeting

```yaml
launch_audience:
  primary_segment:
    who: ""  # Specific job title + company size + pain
    size: ""  # Estimated reachable audience
    where_they_gather: []  # Communities, platforms, events
    trigger_event: ""  # What makes them search for this NOW
    
  secondary_segment:
    who: ""
    size: ""
    where_they_gather: []
    
  anti_audience:  # Who is NOT a good fit
    - ""
    
  early_adopter_profile:
    characteristics: []  # Tech-savvy, vocal, community influence
    motivation: ""  # Why they'll try something new
    how_to_find: ""  # Beta programs, Product Hunt, Twitter/X
```

### Step 3: Positioning & Messaging

Use this formula for your core launch message:

**The Positioning Statement:**
```
For [target audience] who [situation/pain],
[product name] is a [category]
that [key benefit].
Unlike [alternative], we [differentiator].
```

**Message Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Can a stranger understand it in 5 seconds?
- [ ] Does it pass the "So what?" test? (Clear benefit, not feature)
- [ ] Is the differentiator defensible? (Not just "better" or "faster")
- [ ] Would your target customer use these exact words?
- [ ] Does it create urgency or curiosity?

**Messaging Hierarchy (use across all channels):**

| Level | What | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Headline** | One-line value prop | "Ship products your customers actually want" |
| **Subhead** | How it works in one sentence | "AI-powered user research that turns interviews into insights in minutes" |
| **3 Pillars** | Key benefits (not features) | Speed, Accuracy, Integration |
| **Proof Points** | Evidence for each pillar | "10x faster than manual analysis" |
| **Story** | Origin + mission | "We built this because we wasted 100 hours on spreadsheets" |

---

## Phase 3: Pre-Launch Engine (T-minus 8 to 2 weeks)

### Waitlist & Hype Building

**Waitlist Landing Page Must-Haves:**
- [ ] Clear headline (from positioning work above)
- [ ] 1 visual (product screenshot, demo GIF, or hero image)
- [ ] Email capture with clear CTA ("Get early access" > "Sign up")
- [ ] Social proof element (beta user count, testimonials, logos)
- [ ] Urgency/exclusivity ("First 500 get lifetime discount")
- [ ] Share incentive ("Move up the waitlist — invite friends")

**Pre-Launch Content Calendar:**

| Week | Content Type | Channel | Goal |
|------|-------------|---------|------|
| T-8 | Problem awareness post | Blog + social | SEO + establish expertise |
| T-7 | Behind-the-scenes build | Twitter/X thread | Build following |
| T-6 | Data/research piece | LinkedIn + blog | Credibility + email capture |
| T-5 | Early user story / case study | Email + social | Social proof |
| T-4 | Product teaser (screenshot/GIF) | All channels | Hype |
| T-3 | Founder story / "why we built this" | Blog + email | Emotional connection |
| T-2 | Comparison piece (us vs alternatives) | Blog + SEO | Capture searchers |
| T-1 | Launch announcement teaser | Email + social | Set the date |

### Beta Program Design

```yaml
beta_program:
  size: 50-200  # Enough for patterns, small enough for personal touch
  selection_criteria:
    - Matches ICP
    - Active in relevant community
    - Willing to give feedback (written or call)
    - Has the problem RIGHT NOW (not theoretical)
  
  feedback_loop:
    onboarding_survey: true  # Day 1: expectations, setup experience
    weekly_checkin: true  # 3-question pulse (NPS, blockers, requests)
    exit_interview: true  # Why they stayed/left, what they'd pay
    
  incentives:
    - Lifetime discount (20-50%)
    - Founding member badge/status
    - Input on roadmap priorities
    - Early access to future features
    
  success_metrics:
    activation_rate: ">60%"  # Complete core action
    weekly_retention: ">40%"  # Return after first week
    nps_score: ">30"  # Would recommend
    willingness_to_pay: ">50%"  # Would pay at planned price
```

### Partnership & Influencer Outreach

**Outreach Template (Personalize heavily):**
```
Subject: [Specific thing you noticed about them] + quick question

Hey [Name],

Loved your [specific content/post/product] — especially [specific detail that proves you actually consumed it].

We're launching [product] on [date] — it [one-sentence value prop]. Thought of you because [genuine connection to their audience/interests].

Would you be open to:
- [ ] Early access to try it (no strings)
- [ ] A quick collab (guest post, joint webinar, co-promotion)
- [ ] Just sharing it if you genuinely like it

Either way, keep making great stuff.

[Name]
```

**Partner Scoring (prioritize outreach):**

| Factor | Weight | Score (1-5) |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Audience overlap with our ICP | 30% | _ |
| Their engagement rate (not just follower count) | 25% | _ |
| Content quality and brand alignment | 20% | _ |
| Likelihood to respond (warm connection?) | 15% | _ |
| Reciprocal value we can offer | 10% | _ |

### Launch Day War Room Protocol

**Roles:**
- **Commander** — makes go/no-go decisions, handles escalations
- **Comms Lead** — social media, community responses, PR
- **Tech Lead** — monitors systems, fixes issues, deploys hotfixes
- **Support Lead** — triages user issues, identifies patterns
- **Metrics Lead** — real-time dashboard, hourly updates

**Escalation Rules:**
- Site down → Tech Lead fixes, Commander decides on public comms
- Negative press/viral complaint → Comms Lead drafts response, Commander approves
- Payment broken → HIGHEST priority, all hands
- Feature request flood → Log but don't promise, stay on message
- Unexpected traffic spike → Tech Lead scales, Commander decides on throttling

---

## Phase 5: Post-Launch Growth (Days 2-30)

### Week 1: Momentum

| Day | Action | Goal |
|-----|--------|------|
| 2 | Follow up with all Day 1 signups who didn't activate | Activation |
| 3 | Publish "Day 1 results" post (be transparent) | Social proof |
| 4 | Send targeted outreach to communities that responded well | Growth |
| 5 | Collect and publish first testimonials | Trust |
| 6 | Analyze funnel — where are people dropping off? | Optimize |
| 7 | Weekly retrospective — adjust Week 2 plan | Learn |

### Week 2-4: Optimization

**Activation Funnel Analysis:**

```yaml
funnel_analysis:
  stage_1_visit_to_signup:
    rate: ""
    benchmark: "3-8% for cold, 20-40% for warm"
    if_below: "Fix messaging, add social proof, simplify form"
    
  stage_2_signup_to_activation:
    rate: ""
    benchmark: "40-60%"
    if_below: "Simplify onboarding, add quick-win tutorial, reduce time-to-value"
    
  stage_3_activation_to_retention:
    rate: ""
    benchmark: "20-40% weekly"
    if_below: "Core value not clear, add engagement loops, email nurture"
    
  stage_4_retention_to_revenue:
    rate: ""
    benchmark: "2-5% free-to-paid"
    if_below: "Paywall placement, pricing, feature gating"
    
  stage_5_revenue_to_referral:
    rate: ""
    benchmark: "10-20% refer someone"
    if_below: "Add referral program, make sharing easy, incentivize"
```

### User Feedback Collection System

**Feedback Cadence:**
- Day 1: "How was setup?" (1-question email)
- Day 3: "What's your biggest challenge?" (open-ended)
- Day 7: NPS score + "What would make you recommend us?"
- Day 14: Feature request prioritization survey
- Day 30: Willingness-to-pay / pricing feedback

**Feedback Triage Matrix:**

| Signal | Volume | Action |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Bug report | Any | Fix within SLA (P0: 4hrs, P1: 24hrs, P2: sprint) |
| "I expected X" | 3+ users | Messaging problem — update copy/onboarding |
| Feature request | 5+ users | Add to roadmap, validate with interviews |
| Confusion about pricing | 3+ users | Simplify pricing page, add FAQ |
| Positive testimonial | Any | Ask permission to publish, feature on site |
| Churn reason | Any | Categorize and track — top 3 become priorities |

## Phase 6: Launch Retrospective

### 30-Day Review Template

```yaml
launch_retrospective:
  summary:
    launch_date: ""
    launch_type: ""
    primary_goal: ""
    primary_metric_target: ""
    primary_metric_actual: ""
    goal_achieved: true/false
    
  channel_performance:
    - channel: "Email"
      reach: ""
      signups: ""
      conversion_rate: ""
      cost: ""
      cpa: ""
      verdict: ""  # Scale, Optimize, Cut
      
    - channel: "Product Hunt"
      reach: ""
      signups: ""
      conversion_rate: ""
      cost: ""
      cpa: ""
      verdict: ""
      
    # Repeat for each channel
    
  what_worked:
    - ""
    
  what_didnt:
    - ""
    
  surprises:
    - ""  # Unexpected channels, user segments, use cases
    
  key_learnings:
    - ""
    
  next_launch_changes:
    - ""
    
  90_day_plan:
    growth_channels: []  # Double down on winners
    product_priorities: []  # Based on user feedback
    revenue_target: ""
    retention_target: ""
```

### Channel Attribution Scoring

For each channel, calculate:

```
Channel Score = (Signups × Quality Score) / Cost

Quality Score (0-1):
- Activated within 7 days? +0.3
- Still active at day 30? +0.3
- Converted to paid? +0.4
```

Rank channels by score. Top 2-3 become your growth engine. Cut channels scoring below 0.2.

## Advanced Strategies

### Product Hunt Launch Optimization

**Preparation (T-4 weeks):**
- [ ] Ship date chosen (Tuesday-Thursday, avoid holidays)
- [ ] Hunter identified (someone with followers, or self-hunt)
- [ ] Tagline: 60 chars max, clear and catchy
- [ ] First comment drafted (personal story, not sales pitch)
- [ ] 5+ high-quality screenshots/GIFs
- [ ] Maker video (optional, 60-90 seconds)
- [ ] Support team ready for Day 1 questions

**Launch Day:**
- Post at 00:01 PST (start of PH day)
- Share with community but DON'T say "upvote me" (against rules)
- Respond to EVERY comment within 30 minutes
- Share genuine behind-the-scenes updates throughout the day
- Thank supporters individually

**After PH:**
- Add PH badge to site (social proof)
- Email PH visitors who signed up (special welcome)
- Analyze: PH traffic quality vs other channels

### Hacker News Launch Guide

- Post as "Show HN: [product] — [what it does in plain English]"
- Best times: weekday mornings (US East Coast)
- Comment with technical details, be transparent about stack
- Respond thoughtfully to criticism (HN values honesty over marketing)
- Don't ask for upvotes — ever
- Have monitoring ready — HN hug of death is real

### Viral Loop Design

```yaml
viral_loop:
  trigger: ""  # What makes someone share?
  mechanism: ""  # How do they share? (invite, link, embed, social)
  incentive:
    sharer: ""  # What does the referrer get?
    receiver: ""  # What does the new user get?
  friction: ""  # How many clicks to share? (Target: 1-2)
  visibility: ""  # Can non-users SEE the product in use? (Powered by, watermark, social share)
  
  viral_coefficient:
    invites_per_user: ""
    conversion_per_invite: ""
    k_factor: ""  # invites × conversion. K>1 = viral growth
```

### Pricing Launch Strategy

**Launch Pricing Approaches:**

| Strategy | How It Works | Best For |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Founding Price** | 30-50% off, locked forever for early adopters | Building loyal base |
| **Early Bird** | Discount expires after X days/seats | Creating urgency |
| **Freemium** | Free tier hooks, paid tier converts | High-volume B2C/developer |
| **Beta Price → GA Price** | Gradual increase as product matures | Validating willingness-to-pay |
| **Pay What You Want** | Customers choose (with suggested price) | Community/creative products |

**Price Anchoring on Launch Day:**
1. Show the "normal" price first (crossed out)
2. Show launch price with savings highlighted
3. Add time constraint ("Launch price ends [date]")
4. Include value stack ("$2,000 worth of templates included")

## Edge Cases & Special Situations

### Launching into a Crowded Market
- Lead with "unlike [competitor], we [specific difference]"
- Target competitor's most frustrated users (search "[competitor] alternative")
- Build migration tools / comparison content
- Don't compete on features — compete on experience, price, or niche

### Launching with Zero Audience
- Start with 1-1 outreach (100 personal emails > 10,000 cold)
- Find 3-5 micro-communities where your audience gathers
- Offer to solve problems for free in those communities (build reputation first)
- Partner with someone who HAS the audience (revenue share, co-creation)
- Build in public — document the journey (people root for underdogs)

### Failed Launch Recovery
If launch underperforms:
1. Don't panic — most successful products had quiet launches
2. Analyze: Was it product, messaging, channel, or timing?
3. Reposition if needed (same product, different story)
4. Relaunch to a different audience or channel
5. Focus on 10 happy users over 1,000 lukewarm ones

### International Launch
- Localize messaging (not just translate — adapt cultural references)
- Respect local pricing (PPP adjustments, local payment methods)
- Launch in waves by region (not all at once)
- Local influencers > global influencers for each market
- Legal/compliance varies — check data privacy, terms, taxes
