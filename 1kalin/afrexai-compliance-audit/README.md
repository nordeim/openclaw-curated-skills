# Compliance Audit Generator

Run internal compliance audits against SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOX, and CCPA — without paying $20,000+ for a consultant.

## Why This Exists

Pre-audit readiness assessments cost $10,000-$30,000 from consulting firms. Most of that work is structured gap analysis against known control frameworks. Your AI agent can do 80% of it in minutes.

## Supported Frameworks

| Framework | Focus | Who Needs It |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| SOC 2 | Security, Availability, Confidentiality | Any SaaS selling to enterprise |
| ISO 27001 | Information Security Management | Companies with EU/UK clients |
| GDPR | Data Protection | Anyone processing EU personal data |
| HIPAA | Healthcare Data | US healthtech, insurance, providers |
| PCI DSS | Payment Security | Anyone handling credit cards |
| SOX | Financial Controls | US public companies |
| CCPA/CPRA | Consumer Privacy | Companies with California customers |

## What You Get

- Control-by-control gap analysis with actual control numbers
- Remediation roadmap phased by priority (30/60/90 days)
