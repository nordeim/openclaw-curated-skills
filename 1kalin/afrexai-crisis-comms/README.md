# Crisis Communication Playbook

AI-powered crisis communication framework for business teams. Generate holding statements, stakeholder updates, media Q&As, and internal comms in minutes instead of hours.

## What This Does

When a crisis hits, you need a response plan fast. This skill generates:

- Severity-classified response framework (P1-P4)
- Holding statements ready in under 30 minutes
- Stakeholder communication matrix
- Media Q&A preparation
- Internal employee briefings
- Social media response templates
- 72-hour communication timeline

## Why It Matters

The average crisis costs companies $4.2M in brand value when handled poorly. 65% of that damage happens in the first 4 hours — before most teams even have a draft ready.

This skill cuts response time from hours to minutes.

## Crisis Types

Works for data breaches, service outages, product recalls, executive departures, negative press, regulatory investigations, and financial restatements.
