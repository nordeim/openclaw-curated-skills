# afrexai-hiring-scorecard 🖤💛

**Objective candidate scoring for AI agents.** Stop making gut-feel hiring decisions — score candidates on weighted criteria and compare them side by side.

## What It Does

- Generates structured scorecards with 6 weighted dimensions
- Scores candidates 1-5 per criterion with weighted totals
- Compares multiple candidates ranked by score
- Produces executive hiring summaries with clear recommendations

## Quick Start

Install the skill, then tell your agent:

> "Score Sarah Chen for the Senior Backend Engineer role. She has 7 years Python experience, strong system design, quiet but precise communicator."

Your agent builds a full scorecard with weighted scores and a hire/no-hire recommendation.

## Default Criteria

| Criterion | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Technical Skills | 25% |
| Relevant Experience | 20% |
| Culture Fit | 15% |
| Communication | 15% |
| Problem Solving | 15% |
| Growth Potential | 10% |

Customize weights per role. Bump Technical to 40% for senior engineering. Bump Communication to 25% for customer-facing roles.

## Why Use This

Hiring is the highest-leverage decision a company makes. Bad hires cost 3-5x salary. This skill forces structured evaluation so you hire on signal, not vibes.
