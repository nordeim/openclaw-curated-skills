## Phase 6: SDK & Developer Tools Strategy

### SDK Priority Matrix

| Language | Priority | Signal |
|----------|----------|--------|
| JavaScript/TypeScript | Must-have | Largest developer population |
| Python | Must-have | ML/data/scripting dominance |
| Go | High | Cloud-native, DevOps, CLI tools |
| Java/Kotlin | High | Enterprise, Android |
| Ruby | Medium | Startup/Rails ecosystem |
| PHP | Medium | WordPress/Laravel ecosystem |
| Rust | Medium | Systems, performance-critical |
| Swift | Situational | iOS/macOS only |
| C#/.NET | Situational | Microsoft ecosystem |

**Decision Rule:** Ship JS + Python first. Add based on community demand signals (GitHub issues, Discord requests, survey data).

### SDK Design Principles

1. **Idiomatic** — Follow language conventions (snake_case in Python, camelCase in JS)
2. **Type-safe** — Full TypeScript types, Python type hints, Go strong typing
3. **Zero-config default** — Works with just an API key
4. **Discoverable** — Autocomplete-friendly, good IDE experience
5. **Error-helpful** — Errors include what went wrong + how to fix
6. **Versioned** — Semantic versioning, changelog, migration guides
7. **Tested** — >90% coverage, CI on every PR
8. **Documented** — Inline JSDoc/docstrings, separate API reference

### Developer Tools Ecosystem

```
Priority 1 (Must-have):
├── SDKs (JS + Python minimum)
├── API Reference (OpenAPI/Swagger)
├── CLI tool
└── Quickstart templates

Priority 2 (Growth):
├── GitHub Actions / CI integrations
├── VS Code extension
├── Webhook testing tool
└── Postman/Insomnia collection

Priority 3 (Ecosystem):
├── Terraform/Pulumi provider
├── Framework integrations (Next.js, Django, Rails)
├── Database adapters
└── Community SDKs support program
```

## Phase 7: Developer Marketing & Growth

### Developer Acquisition Funnel

```
Awareness → Interest → Signup → Activation → Retention → Advocacy
   |           |          |          |            |           |
   SEO      Tutorial    Free     Hello       Production  Champion
   Social   Demo      Tier      World       Use         Program
   Events   Docs      Account   Working     Habit       Referral
   Ads      Talk                App                     Content
```

### Channel Effectiveness by Stage

| Channel | Awareness | Interest | Activation | Retention |
|---------|-----------|----------|------------|-----------|
| SEO/Content | ★★★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★ | ★★ |
| Developer conferences | ★★★★ | ★★★ | ★★ | ★★ |
| Social (Twitter/X) | ★★★★ | ★★ | ★ | ★★ |
| GitHub/OSS | ★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★★★ |
| Community (Discord) | ★★ | ★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★★★ |
| Newsletter | ★★ | ★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★★ |
| Paid ads (dev sites) | ★★★ | ★★ | ★★ | ★ |
| Developer directories | ★★★ | ★★★ | ★★ | ★ |
| Influencer partnerships | ★★★★ | ★★★ | ★★ | ★ |

### SEO for Developers

**Keyword Strategy:**
- "how to [task] with [technology]" — tutorial keywords
- "[technology] vs [competitor]" — comparison keywords  
- "[technology] [language] tutorial" — getting started
- "[common error message]" — support keywords (high intent!)
- "best [category] API/tool/library" — listicle keywords

**Content Templates for SEO:**
1. **Tutorial:** "How to Build [X] with [Your Product] in [Y] Minutes"
2. **Comparison:** "[Your Product] vs [Competitor]: [Year] Guide"
3. **Integration:** "Using [Your Product] with [Popular Framework]"
4. **Error fix:** "How to Fix [Common Error] in [Your Product]"
5. **Best practices:** "[Your Product] Best Practices for [Use Case]"

### Developer Newsletter Best Practices

- **Cadence:** Bi-weekly or monthly (developers don't want weekly noise)
- **Content mix:** 40% educational, 30% product updates, 20% community, 10% events
- **Format:** Code-first — lead with a useful snippet or technique
- **Subject line:** Include technology name + specific benefit
- **Length:** 3-5 minute read max
- **CTA:** Always link to something they can try immediately

```
Blog post (awareness) → Tutorial (interest) → Signup → 
Discord question (activation) → Conference talk (deepening) → 
Production deployment → Internal champion → Enterprise deal
```

**Attribution Rules:**
- **First touch:** Credit the content/event that brought the developer in
- **Multi-touch:** Weighted across all DevRel touchpoints
- **Self-reported:** "How did you hear about us?" — most reliable signal
- **Influenced vs. sourced:** Separate DevRel-sourced leads from marketing-sourced leads that DevRel influenced

### Reporting Cadence

| Report | Frequency | Audience | Key Metrics |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| DevRel pulse | Weekly | DevRel team | Activities, community health, content published |
| Developer metrics | Monthly | Leadership | MAD, activation rate, funnel metrics |
| Business impact | Quarterly | Exec/board | Revenue influence, pipeline, strategic initiatives |
| Developer survey | Semi-annual | All stakeholders | NPS, satisfaction, feature requests |

---

## Phase 9: Open Source Strategy

### OSS Decision Framework

**Should you open source?**

| Factor | Open Source | Keep Closed |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Business model | Usage-based, hosted service | License-based |
| Moat | Network effects, data, ops | Source code |
| Community | Want contributors | Want users only |
| Trust | Need transparency (security, infra) | IP protection critical |
| Adoption | Developer tool / library | Enterprise product |

### OSS Community Management

**Contribution Funnel:**
```
Star → Watch → Issue → Comment → PR (small fix) → PR (feature) → Maintainer
```

**How to get first 100 contributors:**
1. Label issues as `good-first-issue` and `help-wanted`
2. Write CONTRIBUTING.md with setup instructions (tested monthly)
3. Respond to PRs within 24 hours
4. Celebrate contributors (release notes, social, swag)
5. Create "contributor office hours" for live pairing

**Governance Model Options:**

| Model | Control | Speed | Trust | Best For |
|-------|---------|-------|-------|----------|
| BDFL | High | Fast | Low | Small projects, clear vision |
| Core team | Medium | Medium | Medium | Growing projects |
| Foundation | Low | Slow | High | Industry-standard projects |
| Corporate-backed | High | Fast | Variable | Company-owned OSS |

### License Selection Guide

| License | Permissive? | Copyleft? | Best For |
|---------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| MIT | Very | No | Maximum adoption, libraries |
| Apache 2.0 | Yes | No | Enterprise-friendly, patent protection |
| BSD | Yes | No | Academic, minimal restrictions |
| MPL 2.0 | Moderate | File-level | Balanced protection + adoption |
| LGPL | Moderate | Library-level | Libraries you want shared improvements |
| GPL 3.0 | No | Strong | Apps where you want code sharing |
| AGPL 3.0 | No | Network | SaaS protection (server-side) |
| BSL/SSPL | No | Custom | Protect hosted service business |

### DevRel Team OKRs (Quarterly Template)

```yaml
quarterly_okrs:
  objective_1:
    objective: "Accelerate developer activation"
    key_results:
      - "Reduce time-to-Hello-World from 30 min to under 10 min"
      - "Increase signup-to-activation rate from 15% to 25%"
      - "Ship SDKs for 2 new languages (Go, Java)"
      
  objective_2:
    objective: "Build a self-sustaining developer community"
    key_results:
      - "Grow Discord from 500 to 2,000 members"
      - "Achieve 80% question-answered rate within 4 hours"
      - "Launch champion program with 10 active champions"
      
  objective_3:
    objective: "Establish technical authority in [category]"
    key_results:
      - "Publish 12 technical tutorials (1/week)"
      - "Speak at 3 tier-1 conferences"
      - "Reach 50K monthly unique visitors to docs"
```

---

## Phase 11: Advanced DevRel Patterns

### Developer-Led Growth (DLG) Framework

```
Individual Developer Adoption
         ↓
Team/Project Adoption (organic expansion)
         ↓
Department Standardization
         ↓
Enterprise Contract (sales-assisted)
```

**Key Signals for DLG:**
- Multiple signups from same email domain
- API usage increasing without sales engagement
- Community member asking enterprise questions
- GitHub org showing multiple repos using your product

**Handoff to Sales:**
- 3+ developers from same company = warm lead
- Production API usage above threshold = expansion signal
- Enterprise feature requests = buying signal
- Pass to sales with context: "Company X has 5 devs using us in prod, they asked about SSO/audit logs"

### Global DevRel Strategy

| Region | Priority | Approach |
|--------|----------|----------|
| North America | Must-have | Full program — content, events, community |
| Europe | High | Localized content, local meetups, GDPR compliance |
| India | High | Large dev population, meetups, educational content |
| Southeast Asia | Medium | Growing rapidly, mobile-first content |
| LATAM | Medium | Portuguese/Spanish content, regional events |
| Japan/Korea | Situational | Local partner, localized docs essential |

### Crisis Management for DevRel

**Common Crises:**

| Crisis | Response | Timeline |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Breaking API change | Immediate notice, migration guide, grace period | <1 hour notice |
| Major outage | Status page, community update, post-mortem | <30 min status |
| Security vulnerability | Advisory, patch, clear upgrade path | <4 hours |
| Controversial company decision | Honest community post, Q&A | <24 hours |
| Community toxicity | Swift moderation, statement, policy update | <2 hours |
| Competitor FUD | Facts-only response, comparison page, community defense | <24 hours |

## Common Mistakes

| # | Mistake | Fix |
|---|---------|-----|
| 1 | Measuring vanity metrics only (stars, followers) | Track activation + retention + business attribution |
| 2 | Building for developers you wish you had, not who you have | Interview actual users, check analytics |
| 3 | Treating DevRel as marketing | DevRel is product + engineering + marketing |
| 4 | No free tier or overly restricted trial | Generous free tier = developer adoption |
| 5 | Ignoring DX for marketing | Fix the docs before buying conference booths |
| 6 | Community on too many platforms | Pick 1-2, do them well |
| 7 | Not involving DevRel in product decisions | DevRel is the voice of the developer |
| 8 | Expecting immediate revenue attribution | Developer influence has 6-18 month cycles |
| 9 | Hiring marketers for DevRel | Hire developers who can communicate |
| 10 | Not automating community management | Use bots for FAQ, routing, onboarding |

## Edge Cases

### Developer Tool vs. Enterprise Platform
- Tool: Focus on bottom-up adoption, community, OSS
- Platform: Add top-down materials (case studies, ROI calculators, security docs)

### Pre-Launch DevRel
- Build waitlist with early access program
- Create content about the problem space (not your product)
- Recruit design partners, not users
- Launch with community from day 1

### Tiny Budget (<$10K)
- Write great docs (free)
- Answer every question on Stack Overflow and Reddit (free)
- Create 1 killer tutorial per month (time only)
- Build in public on Twitter/X (free)
- Speak at free community meetups (time only)

### B2B Enterprise DevRel
- Content needs both IC developer AND decision-maker versions
- Add compliance/security docs alongside tutorials
- Create "internal champion kit" for developers to sell upward
- Account-based DevRel for top prospects
