## 1. Content-Based Generation

Generate slides from user-provided text content.

### When to Use
- User provides content directly in their message
- User says "create a presentation about X"
- User provides structured outline or bullet points

### Workflow

**Step 1: Prepare Content**

Structure the content clearly for best results:

```
Title: [Main Topic]

Section 1: [Subtopic]
- Key point 1
- Key point 2
- Key point 3

Section 2: [Subtopic]
- Key point 1
- Key point 2
```

**Step 2: Choose Theme (Required)**

Search for an appropriate theme (themeId is required):

```bash
python scripts/search_themes.py --query "business"
python scripts/search_themes.py --query "professional"
python scripts/search_themes.py --query "creative"
```

Pick a theme ID from the results.

**Step 3: Generate Slides**

Use the `generate_slides.py` script with the theme ID:

```bash
# Basic generation (theme ID required)
python scripts/generate_slides.py --content "Your content here" --theme-id "theme123"

# In different language
python scripts/generate_slides.py --content "Your content" --theme-id "theme123" --language "Spanish"

# Async mode for longer presentations
python scripts/generate_slides.py --content "Your content" --theme-id "theme123" --mode async
```

**Step 4: Handle Results**

**Sync mode response:**
```json
{
  "slideUrl": "https://2slides.com/slides/abc123",
  "pdfUrl": "https://2slides.com/slides/abc123/download",
  "status": "completed"
}
```

Provide both URLs to the user:
- `slideUrl`: Interactive online slides
- `pdfUrl`: Downloadable PDF version

**Async mode response:**
```json
{
  "jobId": "job123",
  "status": "pending"
}
```

Poll for results:
```bash
python scripts/get_job_status.py --job-id "job123"
```

---

## 2. Reference Image Generation

Generate slides that match the style of a reference image.

### When to Use
- User provides an image URL and says "create slides like this"
- User wants to match existing brand/design style
- User has a template image they want to emulate

### Workflow

**Step 1: Verify Image URL**

Ensure the reference image is:
- Publicly accessible URL
- Valid image format (PNG, JPG, etc.)
- Represents the desired slide style

**Step 2: Generate Slides**

Use the `generate_slides.py` script with `--reference-image`:

```bash
python scripts/generate_slides.py \
  --content "Your presentation content" \
  --reference-image "https://example.com/template.jpg" \
  --language "Auto"
```

**Optional parameters:**
```bash
--aspect-ratio "16:9"           # width:height format (e.g., "16:9", "4:3")
--resolution "2K"               # "1K", "2K" (default), or "4K"
--page 5                        # Number of slides (0 for auto-detection, max 100)
--content-detail "concise"      # "concise" (brief) or "standard" (detailed)
```

**Note:** This uses Nano Banana Pro mode with credit costs:
- 1K/2K: 100 credits per page
- 4K: 200 credits per page

**Step 3: Handle Results**

This mode always runs synchronously and returns:
```json
{
  "slideUrl": "https://2slides.com/workspace?jobId=...",
  "pdfUrl": "https://...pdf...",
  "status": "completed",
  "message": "Successfully generated N slides",
  "slidePageCount": N
}
```

Provide both URLs to the user:
- `slideUrl`: View slides in 2slides workspace
- `pdfUrl`: Direct PDF download (expires in 1 hour)

**Processing time:** ~30 seconds per page (30-60 seconds typical for 1-2 pages)

---

## 3. Custom PDF Generation

Generate custom-designed slides from text without needing a reference image.

### When to Use
- User wants custom design without providing a reference image
- User requests "create PDF slides"
- User wants to specify design characteristics
- Alternative to theme-based generation with more design flexibility

### Workflow

**Step 1: Prepare Content**

Structure the content clearly:

```
Title: [Main Topic]

Section 1: [Subtopic]
- Key point 1
- Key point 2

Section 2: [Subtopic]
- Key point 1
- Key point 2
```

**Step 2: Generate Slides**

Use the `create_pdf_slides.py` script:

```bash
# Basic generation
python scripts/create_pdf_slides.py --content "Your content here"

# With design specifications
python scripts/create_pdf_slides.py \
  --content "Sales Report Q4 2025" \
  --design-spec "modern minimalist, blue color scheme"

# High resolution with auto page detection
python scripts/create_pdf_slides.py \
  --content "Marketing Plan" \
  --resolution "4K" \
  --page 0 \
  --content-detail "standard"
```

**Optional parameters:**
```bash
--design-spec "text"            # Design specifications (e.g., "corporate professional")
--aspect-ratio "16:9"           # width:height format
--resolution "2K"               # "1K", "2K" (default), or "4K"
--page 5                        # Number of slides (0 for auto-detection, max 100)
--content-detail "concise"      # "concise" (brief) or "standard" (detailed)
--language "Auto"               # Language for content
```

**Step 3: Handle Results**

Returns same structure as create-like-this:
```json
{
  "slideUrl": "https://2slides.com/workspace?jobId=...",
  "pdfUrl": "https://...pdf...",
  "status": "completed",
  "message": "Successfully generated N slides",
  "slidePageCount": N
}
```

**Notes:**
- Same credit costs as create-like-this (100 credits/page for 1K/2K, 200 for 4K)
- Processing time: ~30 seconds per page
- Automatically generates PDF
- Uses AI to create custom design based on content and specs

---

## 4. Document Summarization

Generate slides from document content.

### When to Use
- User uploads a document (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)
- User says "create slides from this document"
- User wants to summarize long content into presentation format

### Workflow

**Step 1: Read Document**

Use appropriate tool to read the document content:
- PDF: Use PDF reading tools
- DOCX: Use DOCX reading tools
- TXT/MD: Use Read tool

**Step 2: Extract Key Points**

Analyze the document and extract:
- Main topics and themes
- Key points for each section
- Important data, quotes, or examples
- Logical flow and structure

**Step 3: Structure Content**

Format extracted information into presentation structure:

```
Title: [Document Main Topic]

Introduction
- Context
- Purpose
- Overview

[Section 1 from document]
- Key point 1
- Key point 2
- Supporting detail

[Section 2 from document]
- Key point 1
- Key point 2
- Supporting detail

Conclusion
- Summary
- Key takeaways
- Next steps
```

**Step 4: Generate Slides**

Use content-based generation workflow (Section 1). First search for a theme, then generate:

```bash
# Search for appropriate theme
python scripts/search_themes.py --query "business"

# Generate with theme ID
python scripts/generate_slides.py --content "[Structured content from step 3]" --theme-id "theme123"
```

**Tips:**
- Keep slides concise (3-5 points per slide)
- Focus on key insights, not full text
- Use document headings as slide titles
- Include important statistics or quotes
- Ask user if they want specific sections highlighted

---

## 5. Voice Narration

Add AI-generated voice narration to slides.

### When to Use
- User wants to add audio to slides
- User requests "add voice narration" or "generate audio"
- User wants presentations with spoken content
- User needs multi-speaker narration

### Prerequisites

**IMPORTANT:** The slide generation job must be completed before adding narration.

1. Generate slides first using any method (Section 1, 2, 3, or 4)
2. Get the job ID from the generation result
3. Ensure job status is "completed" before requesting narration

### Workflow

**Step 1: Choose Voice**

30 voices available including:
- Puck (default)
- Aoede
- Charon
- Kore
- Fenrir
- Phoebe
- And 24 more...

List all voices:
```bash
python scripts/generate_narration.py --list-voices
```

**Step 2: Generate Narration**

Use the `generate_narration.py` script with the job ID:

```bash
# Basic narration with default voice
python scripts/generate_narration.py --job-id "abc-123-def-456"

# With specific voice
python scripts/generate_narration.py --job-id "abc-123-def-456" --voice "Aoede"

# Multi-speaker mode
python scripts/generate_narration.py --job-id "abc-123-def-456" --multi-speaker

# In specific language
python scripts/generate_narration.py \
  --job-id "abc-123-def-456" \
  --language "Spanish" \
  --voice "Charon"
```

**Parameters:**
- `--job-id`: Job ID from slide generation (required, must be UUID format for Nano Banana)
- `--voice`: Voice name (default: "Puck")
- `--multi-speaker`: Enable multi-speaker mode (default: off)
- `--language`: Language for narration (default: "Auto")

**Step 3: Check Status**

Narration generation runs asynchronously:

```bash
python scripts/get_job_status.py --job-id "abc-123-def-456"
```

**Step 4: Handle Results**

Once completed, the job will include narration files. Use download endpoint (Section 6) to get audio files.

**Notes:**
- **Cost:** 210 credits per page (10 for text, 200 for audio)
- Processing time varies by slide count
- 30 voice options available
- Supports 19 languages plus auto-detection
- Multi-speaker mode uses different voices for variety

---

## 6. Download Export

Download slides as PNG images and voice narrations as WAV files.

### When to Use
- User wants to download slides as images
- User needs voice files separately
- User wants transcripts
- User needs slides in image format for other tools

### Workflow

**Step 1: Verify Job Complete**

Ensure slides (and optionally narration) are generated and job is completed.

**Step 2: Download Archive**

Use the `download_slides_pages_voices.py` script:

```bash
# Download with default filename (<job_id>.zip)
python scripts/download_slides_pages_voices.py --job-id "abc-123-def-456"

# Download to specific path
python scripts/download_slides_pages_voices.py \
  --job-id "abc-123-def-456" \
  --output "my-presentation.zip"
```

**Step 3: Extract Contents**

The ZIP archive contains:
- **Pages:** PNG files for each slide
- **Voices:** WAV audio files (if narration was generated)
- **Transcripts:** Text transcripts of narration

**Notes:**
- **Cost:** Completely FREE (no credits used)
- Download URLs valid for **1 hour only**
- Includes all pages and voice files
- High quality PNG export
- WAV format for audio

```bash
# Search for specific style (query is required)
python scripts/search_themes.py --query "business"
python scripts/search_themes.py --query "creative"
python scripts/search_themes.py --query "education"
python scripts/search_themes.py --query "professional"

# Get more results
python scripts/search_themes.py --query "modern" --limit 50
```

**Theme selection:**

1. Show user available themes with names and descriptions
2. Ask user to choose or let them use default
3. Use the theme ID in generation request
