# Campaign Types

## 1. Custom Signal Campaign
**When:** You have strong research data (case studies, pricing insights, reviews, hiring).

**Structure:**
- **Subject:** 2-4 words, intriguing.
- **First line:** Custom signal with `{{variable}}`.
- **Body:** Value prop + case study proof.
- **CTA:** Low-effort question.

## 2. Creative Ideas Campaign
**When:** You can generate specific, credible ideas for them.

**Requirements:**
- Define 3-5 specific features/capabilities.
- Generate 3 bullet point ideas, each using ONE feature.

**Structure:**
```
{{First name}} – I was back on your site today and had some marketing ideas for you.

{{Creative Ideas}}
• Idea 1: [Specific action using Feature X]—would help with [their pain]
• Idea 2: [Specific action using Feature Y]—could improve [their goal]
• Idea 3: [Specific action using Feature Z]—might address [their challenge]

But of course, I wrote this without knowing anything about your current bottlenecks.

If it's interesting, we could hop on a call and I'd be happy to share what's working in the {{industry}} industry.
```

## 3. Whole Offer Campaign
**When:** Limited data availability or self-selecting offer.

**Structure:**
- **Subject:** Describes the pain/outcome.
- **Preview text:** Completes the offer.
- **Body:** Explain the offer, light personalization.
- **CTA:** Simple yes/no.

## 4. Fallback Campaign ("Let Me Know If...")
**When:** You're not 100% sure they're the right person.

**Structure:**
```
{{First name}} – let me know if {{employee_1}} or {{employee_2}} would be better to speak about {{specific_problem}}.

[Rest of email]
```
**Why it works:** Shows research (employee names) and gives an easy out.
