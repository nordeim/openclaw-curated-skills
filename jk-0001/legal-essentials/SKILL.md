# Legal Essentials

## Overview
Legal issues aren't sexy, but they protect your business and personal assets. Most solopreneurs ignore legal until it's too late — then one lawsuit or contract dispute wipes them out. This playbook covers the absolute essentials: business structure, contracts, IP protection, and liability. **Disclaimer: This is educational content, not legal advice. Consult a lawyer for your specific situation.**

## Step 1: Choose Your Business Structure

Your business structure affects taxes, liability, and paperwork. Pick the right one from day one.

**Structure comparison (U.S.):**

| Structure | Liability Protection | Tax Treatment | Complexity | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Sole Proprietorship** | ❌ None (personal assets at risk) | Pass-through (report on personal tax) | Very Low | Testing an idea, no risk |
| **LLC (Single-member)** | ✅ Yes (separates personal/business) | Pass-through (default) | Low-Medium | Most solopreneurs |
| **LLC (Multi-member)** | ✅ Yes | Pass-through (partnership) | Medium | Partnerships |
| **S-Corp** | ✅ Yes | Pass-through (with payroll requirements) | Medium-High | Higher revenue ($100K+ profit) |
| **C-Corp** | ✅ Yes | Double taxation (corp + personal) | High | Raising VC funding |

**Decision tree:**
- Revenue < $50K/year, just starting → Sole Proprietorship (simplest, but no liability protection)
- Revenue $50K-100K/year, want liability protection → LLC (most common for solopreneurs)
- Profit > $100K/year, want to save on self-employment tax → S-Corp (requires payroll)
- Planning to raise VC funding → C-Corp (required by most investors)

**LLC benefits:**
- Separates personal assets from business liabilities (if sued, they can't take your house)
- Simple to set up ($50-500 depending on state)
- Flexible tax treatment (can elect S-Corp status later)
- Professional credibility (clients prefer working with LLCs vs sole proprietors)

**How to form an LLC:**
1. Choose a business name (check availability in your state)
2. File Articles of Organization with your state (online, $50-500 fee)
3. Get an EIN (Employer Identification Number) from IRS (free, online)
4. Open a business bank account (use EIN, not SSN)
5. Create an Operating Agreement (even if single-member — Google templates)

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks. Use a service like LegalZoom or Northwest Registered Agent if you want help (~$300 total).

## Step 2: Contracts and Agreements

Verbal agreements are worthless. Everything business-related should have a written contract.

**Essential contracts for solopreneurs:**

### 1. Client Service Agreement (for service businesses)
Use whenever you do work for a client. Covers:
- Scope of work (what you'll deliver)
- Timeline and deadlines
- Payment terms (amount, schedule, late fees)
- Revisions or change requests (how many included, cost for additional)
- Termination clause (how either party can end the contract)
- Liability limitations (cap damages at contract value)
- IP ownership (who owns the work product)

**Template sources:** Bonsai, HoneyBook, or a lawyer (~$500-1,500 for a custom template you can reuse).

### 2. Terms of Service / Terms and Conditions (for SaaS or products)
Required on your website if you sell a product or service. Covers:
- What your service does and doesn't do
- User responsibilities (acceptable use policy)
- Payment terms and refund policy
- Limitation of liability (you're not liable for indirect damages)
- Dispute resolution (arbitration vs. court)

**Template sources:** Termly, TermsFeed (free generators), or Bonsai (~$200-500 for lawyer review).

### 3. Privacy Policy (required if you collect ANY user data)
Legally required in most jurisdictions if you collect emails, names, or any personal data. Covers:
- What data you collect
- How you use it
- Who you share it with (e.g., email service providers)
- How users can request deletion (GDPR compliance)

**Template sources:** Termly, TermsFeed (free generators), or lawyer review (~$200-500).

### 4. Independent Contractor Agreement (if you hire contractors)
Use whenever you hire a freelancer or contractor. Covers:
- Scope of work
- Payment terms
- IP ownership (you own the work, not them)
- Confidentiality (they can't share your business info)
- Independent contractor status (they're not an employee — important for taxes)

**Template sources:** Bonsai, or lawyer template (~$300-500).

### 5. Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) (if sharing sensitive info)
Use when discussing your idea, product, or business details with potential partners, investors, or contractors. Covers:
- What information is confidential
- How long the NDA lasts
- Exceptions (publicly available info)

**Template sources:** Bonsai, or lawyer template (~$200).

## Step 3: Protect Your Intellectual Property (IP)

Your IP (brand, content, code, designs) is often your most valuable asset. Protect it.

**IP types and how to protect:**

### 1. Trademarks (brand names, logos)
- **What:** Protects your business name and logo from copycats
- **When to file:** When you have revenue and a brand worth protecting ($50K+ revenue recommended)
- **How:** File with USPTO (U.S. Patent and Trademark Office) — DIY (~$250-400) or use a lawyer (~$1,000-2,000)
- **Timeline:** 6-12 months to approval

### 2. Copyrights (written content, code, designs)
- **What:** Protects original creative works (blog posts, software code, graphics)
- **When to file:** Optional (you automatically own copyright when you create something), but filing gives you stronger legal standing if you sue
- **How:** File with U.S. Copyright Office — DIY (~$45-65 online)
- **Timeline:** 3-6 months

### 3. Patents (inventions, processes)
- **What:** Protects novel inventions or processes
- **When to file:** Rarely relevant for solopreneurs (expensive, complex, long process)
- **How:** Hire a patent lawyer (~$5,000-15,000+)
- **Timeline:** 2-3 years

**For most solopreneurs:** Trademark your brand name once you have traction. Copyright registration is optional (you already own it). Skip patents unless you have a truly novel invention and funding.

**Cheapest IP protection:** Use "™" symbol next to your brand name even before filing (shows intent to trademark). Put "© [Year] [Your Name/Company]" on your website footer (establishes copyright claim).

## Step 4: Limit Your Liability

Mistakes happen. Protect yourself from catastrophic financial loss.

**Liability protection strategies:**

### 1. Use an LLC or Corp
Separates personal assets from business liabilities. If your business gets sued, they can't take your house, car, or savings (unless you pierce the corporate veil — see below).

### 2. Get business insurance
- **General Liability Insurance:** Covers bodily injury, property damage, personal injury. Cost: $300-1,000/year. Recommended for: anyone with in-person customers or physical operations.
- **Professional Liability Insurance (E&O):** Covers mistakes, negligence, failure to deliver. Cost: $500-2,000/year. Recommended for: consultants, freelancers, service providers.
- **Cyber Liability Insurance:** Covers data breaches, hacking. Cost: $1,000-3,000/year. Recommended for: SaaS, anyone handling customer data.

**Where to buy:** Hiscox, Next Insurance, Embroker (online, instant quotes).

### 3. Include limitation of liability clauses in contracts
Cap your liability at the value of the contract. Example: "In no event shall liability exceed the total amount paid under this agreement."

### 4. Don't pierce the corporate veil
If you have an LLC or Corp, keep business and personal finances SEPARATE. Don't:
- Pay personal expenses from business account
- Mix business and personal funds
- Fail to maintain corporate formalities (annual reports, separate accounts)

If you mix them, a court can "pierce the veil" and hold you personally liable.

## Step 5: Know When to Hire a Lawyer

DIY works for many legal tasks. But some situations require a lawyer.

**When to DIY (use templates):**
- Forming an LLC in a simple state (Delaware, Wyoming, Nevada)
- Standard client contracts (if using vetted templates)
- Privacy policy and terms of service (if using reliable generators)

**When to hire a lawyer:**
- You're sued or threatened with a lawsuit → hire immediately
- Complex contracts (partnerships, investor agreements, large client deals)
- IP disputes (someone copied your product, trademark infringement)
- Employment issues (if you hire employees, not just contractors)
- Regulatory compliance (if you operate in a heavily regulated industry — finance, healthcare, etc.)

**How to find a lawyer:**
- Ask other entrepreneurs for referrals
- Use Avvo or Martindale to search by specialty
- For one-off questions: use UpCounsel or Rocket Lawyer (pay per question, $100-500)

**Cost expectations:**
- Consultation: $200-500/hour
- Contract drafting: $500-2,000
- Lawsuit defense: $5,000-50,000+ (depends on complexity)

**Rule:** Spend $500-1,000 early on solid contracts and structure. It's far cheaper than fixing a legal mess later.

## Step 6: Understand Common Legal Risks (and How to Avoid Them)

**Risk 1: Not having terms of service**
→ Someone uses your product in a harmful way, sues you for damages.
**Solution:** Post terms of service on your site. Include liability limitations.

**Risk 2: Not having client contracts**
→ Client refuses to pay, claims you didn't deliver what was promised.
**Solution:** Always use written contracts. No handshake deals.

**Risk 3: Hiring contractors as employees**
→ IRS reclassifies them as employees, you owe back taxes and penalties.
**Solution:** Use independent contractor agreements. Don't control their schedule or method.

**Risk 4: Violating GDPR or privacy laws**
→ Fines for mishandling user data (up to 4% of revenue under GDPR).
**Solution:** Post a privacy policy. Don't sell user data. Allow data deletion requests.

**Risk 5: Using copyrighted content without permission**
→ Get sued for copyright infringement.
**Solution:** Only use content you created, purchased, or that's licensed (Creative Commons, stock photos).

## Legal Mistakes to Avoid
- **Operating as sole proprietor when you should have an LLC.** One lawsuit can bankrupt you personally.
- **Not having written contracts.** Verbal agreements are impossible to enforce.
- **Mixing personal and business finances.** Pierces the corporate veil, exposes personal assets.
- **Copying someone else's content, code, or designs.** Copyright infringement lawsuits are expensive.
- **Not posting terms of service or privacy policy.** Leaves you exposed to lawsuits and regulatory fines.
- **Hiring contractors without agreements.** IRS can reclassify them as employees, costing you thousands in back taxes.
