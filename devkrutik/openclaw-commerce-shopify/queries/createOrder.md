# Shopify Order & Draft Order Creation

This guide helps you generate accurate GraphQL mutations for creating orders and draft orders in Shopify.

## Instructions for Mutation Generation

When a user requests to create orders or draft orders, follow these steps:

1. **Read and understand** the official Shopify documentation thoroughly
2. **Analyze** the user's specific requirements
3. **Generate** the appropriate GraphQL mutation based on the documentation
4. **Apply** rate limiting best practices
5. **Validate** that all required fields are included in the mutation

## Rate Limiting Guidelines

**Critical**: Always follow Shopify's rate limiting rules when creating mutations.

**Documentation**: https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/rate-limits

**Note**: *Review rate limit documentation only when you encounter throttling issues or need to optimize expensive mutations*

### Key Rate Limiting Principles

1. **GraphQL Admin API Rate Limits**:
   - Calculated cost-based system (not simple request count)
   - Each field and connection has a cost
   - Maximum 1000 points per app per store per minute (by default)
   - Restore rate: 50 points per second

2. **Mutation Cost Calculation**:
   - Mutations generally have higher costs than queries
   - Complex input objects increase cost
   - Nested line items and customer data add to cost
   - Formula: `cost = base_mutation_cost + input_complexity`

3. **Best Practices for Mutation Generation**:
   - **Include only required fields**: Don't add optional fields unless needed
   - **Batch operations**: Create multiple orders in separate mutations if needed
   - **Validate input**: Ensure all required data is provided before mutation
   - **Handle errors**: Always check for user errors in mutation response
   - **Use draft orders first**: For complex scenarios, consider draft orders then complete

4. **Cost Optimization Examples**:
   ```graphql
   # ❌ HIGH COST - Creates order with excessive optional fields
   mutation orderCreate($input: OrderInput!) {
     orderCreate(input: $input) {
       order { id name customer { ... } lineItems { ... } shippingAddress { ... } billingAddress { ... } }
       userErrors { field message }
     }
   }
   
   # ✅ LOW COST - Creates order with essential fields only
   mutation orderCreate($input: OrderInput!) {
     orderCreate(input: $input) {
       order { id name totalPriceSet { shopMoney { amount } } }
       userErrors { field message }
     }
   }
   ```

## Mutation Generation Rules

### Variable Placeholders

When generating mutations, use these placeholders that will be replaced with actual values:

| Placeholder | Description | Default Value | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| `$CUSTOMER_ID$` | Customer ID | Ask user if not provided | `gid://shopify/Customer/123456789` |
| `$PRODUCT_VARIANT_ID$` | Product variant ID | Ask user if not provided | `gid://shopify/ProductVariant/987654321` |
| `$QUANTITY$ | Item quantity | 1 | `2` |
| `$EMAIL$ | Customer email | Ask user if not provided | `"customer@example.com"` |
| `$SHIPPING_ADDRESS$ | Shipping address object | Ask user if not provided | Address object |
| `$BILLING_ADDRESS$ | Billing address object | Ask user if not provided | Address object |
| `$SEND_RECEIPT$ | Send email receipt | `false` | `true` |
| `$SEND_INVOICE$ | Send draft invoice | `false` | `true` |

### Mutation Structure Template

```graphql
mutation orderCreate($input: OrderInput!) {
  orderCreate(input: $input) {
    order {
      id
      name
      createdAt
      totalPriceSet {
        shopMoney {
          amount
          currencyCode
        }
      }
    }
    userErrors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```

## Response Guidelines

When generating a mutation for the user:

**Important**: Users are Shopify merchants, not technical developers. Always explain in simple, business-friendly terms.

1. **Explain what the mutation does** in simple business terms (e.g., "This will create a new order for your customer")
2. **Explain what information is needed** in simple terms (e.g., "I'll need the customer's email and what they want to order")
3. **Explain any limitations** in simple terms (e.g., "This creates the order but doesn't process payment")
4. **Ask for clarification** if requirements are unclear, using business language
5. **Offer practical options** that relate to their business needs
6. **Avoid technical jargon** - no mentions of "cost", "mutation complexity", "optimization", etc.

### Example Response Format

```
I'll help you create a new [order/draft order] for your business.

**Mutation:**
```graphql
mutation orderCreate($input: OrderInput!) {
  orderCreate(input: $input) {
    order {
      id
      name
      totalPriceSet {
        shopMoney {
          amount
          currencyCode
        }
      }
    }
    userErrors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```

**What this does:**
- Creates a new order with the details you provide
- Shows the order number and total amount
- Lets you know if there are any errors
- This keeps the process simple and reliable

To create this order, I'll need:
- Customer email address
- Product details (what they're ordering)
- Shipping address
- Any special instructions?

Would you like to:
- Create a draft order first (easier to modify)?
- Set up automatic email receipt?
- Include tax calculations?
- Add shipping costs?
```

## Common Mutation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Basic Order Creation
```graphql
mutation orderCreate($input: OrderInput!) {
  orderCreate(input: $input) {
    order {
      id
      name
      email
      totalPriceSet {
        shopMoney {
          amount
          currencyCode
        }
      }
    }
    userErrors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```

### Pattern 2: Draft Order Creation
```graphql
mutation draftOrderCreate($input: DraftOrderInput!) {
  draftOrderCreate(input: $input) {
    draftOrder {
      id
      name
      email
      totalPrice
      status
    }
    userErrors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```

### Pattern 3: Order with Customer Information
```graphql
mutation orderCreate($input: OrderInput!) {
  orderCreate(input: $input) {
    order {
      id
      name
      customer {
        id
        email
        firstName
        lastName
      }
      totalPriceSet {
        shopMoney {
          amount
          currencyCode
        }
      }
    }
    userErrors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```

### Pattern 4: Draft Order with Invoice
```graphql
mutation draftOrderCreate($input: DraftOrderInput!) {
  draftOrderCreate(input: $input) {
    draftOrder {
      id
      name
      email
      totalPrice
      invoiceUrl
      status
    }
    userErrors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```

## Important Notes

- **Always check the documentation** before generating mutations - field requirements may change
- **Validate required fields** - mutations will fail without required input data
- **Handle user errors** - always check the userErrors field in response
- **Test with simple orders** first before creating complex ones
- **Use draft orders** for complex scenarios that might need modifications
- **Payment processing** - orderCreate doesn't process payments, use payment mutations separately
- **Inventory management** - creating orders affects inventory levels
- **Customer creation** - you can create new customers or use existing ones

  - *Review only when you need to understand product variant structure*

## Troubleshooting

If a mutation fails or returns unexpected results:

1. **Check required fields** - ensure all mandatory input fields are provided
2. **Verify customer ID format** - must be full GID (e.g., `gid://shopify/Customer/123`)
3. **Check product variant availability** - variant must exist and be in stock
4. **Review user errors** - the response will explain what went wrong
5. **Validate address format** - shipping/billing addresses must be properly formatted
6. **Check API permissions** - ensure app has required scopes for order creation
7. **Verify currency** - currency must match shop's currency settings
