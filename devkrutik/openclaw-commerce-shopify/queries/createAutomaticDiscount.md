## Rate Limiting Guidelines

**Critical**: Always follow Shopify's rate limiting rules when creating automatic discounts.

**Documentation**: https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/rate-limits

**Note**: *Review rate limit documentation only when you encounter throttling issues or need to optimize expensive mutations*

### Key Rate Limiting Principles

1. **GraphQL Admin API Rate Limits**:
   - Calculated cost-based system (not simple request count)
   - Each field and connection has a cost
   - Maximum 1000 points per app per store per minute (by default)
   - Restore rate: 50 points per second

2. **Automatic Discount Creation Cost Calculation**:
   - Automatic discount creation mutations have high costs due to complexity
   - Condition logic and eligibility rules significantly increase cost
   - Customer targeting and segmentation add additional complexity
   - Formula: `cost = base_mutation_cost + condition_complexity + eligibility_logic + customer_targeting`

3. **Best Practices for Automatic Discount Creation Mutation Generation**:
   - **Include only required fields**: Don't add optional fields unless needed
   - **Validate condition logic**: Ensure discount conditions make business sense
   - **Test discount behavior**: Validate automatic application before activation
   - **Consider customer experience**: Design automatic discounts for smooth checkout
   - **Optimize condition evaluation**: Structure conditions for efficient evaluation

4. **Cost Optimization Examples**:
   ```graphql
   # ❌ HIGH COST - Creates discount with excessive condition logic
   mutation discountAutomaticAppCreate($input: DiscountAutomaticAppInput!) {
     discountAutomaticAppCreate(input: $input) {
       discount { id title conditions { ... } 
       customerSelection { ... } discountClass { ... } }
       userErrors { field message }
     }
   }
   
   # ✅ LOW COST - Creates discount with essential fields only
   mutation discountAutomaticAppCreate($input: DiscountAutomaticAppInput!) {
     discountAutomaticAppCreate(input: $input) {
       discount {
         id
         title
         status
         startsAt
         endsAt
         summary
       }
       userErrors {
         field
         message
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Mutation Generation Rules

## Response Guidelines

When generating an automatic discount creation mutation for the user:

**Important**: Users are Shopify merchants, not technical developers. Always explain in simple, business-friendly terms.

1. **Explain what the mutation does** in simple business terms (e.g., "This will create an automatic discount that applies when customers meet certain conditions")
2. **Explain what information is needed** in simple terms (e.g., "I'll need the discount title, conditions, and who should receive it")
3. **Explain any limitations** in simple terms (e.g., "This creates the discount but you'll need to activate it before it applies to customer orders")
4. **Ask for clarification** if requirements are unclear, using business language
5. **Offer practical options** that relate to their business needs
6. **Avoid technical jargon** - no mentions of "cost", "mutation complexity", "optimization", etc.

### Example Response Format

```
I'll help you create a new automatic discount for your store.

**Mutation:**
```graphql
mutation discountAutomaticBasicCreate($input: DiscountAutomaticBasicInput!) {
  discountAutomaticBasicCreate(input: $input) {
    discount {
      id
      title
      status
      startsAt
      endsAt
      summary
      customerSelection {
        __typename
        ... on DiscountCustomerAll {
          allCustomers
        }
        ... on DiscountCustomerSegments {
          segments {
            id
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }
    userErrors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```

**What this does:**
This creates an automatic discount that will be applied to customer orders when specific conditions are met.

**What I need from you:**
- Discount title and conditions (e.g., "Volume Discount" for orders over $100)
- Discount type and amount (percentage or fixed amount)
- Who should receive the discount (all customers or specific groups)
- When the discount should start and end

**Important notes:**
- Automatic discounts apply without customers needing to enter codes
- You can set conditions like minimum purchase amounts or quantities
- Consider how the discount will affect your profit margins
- The discount will need to be activated before it applies to orders
