# Shopify Customer Queries

This guide helps you generate accurate GraphQL queries for fetching customer information from Shopify.

## Instructions for Query Generation

When a user requests to fetch customer data, follow these steps:

1. **Read and understand** the official Shopify documentation thoroughly
2. **Analyze** the user's specific customer data requirements
3. **Generate** the appropriate GraphQL query based on the documentation
4. **Apply** rate limiting best practices
5. **Validate** that all required fields are included in the query

- Identifier validation and formatting
- Multiple identifier support

## Rate Limiting Guidelines

**Critical**: Always follow Shopify's rate limiting rules when querying customer data.

**Documentation**: https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/rate-limits

**Note**: *Review rate limit documentation only when you encounter throttling issues or need to optimize expensive queries*

### Key Rate Limiting Principles

1. **GraphQL Admin API Rate Limits**:
   - Calculated cost-based system (not simple request count)
   - Each field and connection has a cost
   - Maximum 1000 points per app per store per minute (by default)
   - Restore rate: 50 points per second

2. **Customer Query Cost Calculation**:
   - Customer queries have moderate costs
   - Complex filters and connections increase cost
   - Large result sets require pagination to manage costs
   - Formula: `cost = base_query_cost + filter_complexity + result_size`

3. **Best Practices for Customer Query Generation**:
   - **Include only required fields**: Don't request unnecessary customer data
   - **Use specific filters**: Narrow results to reduce data transfer
   - **Implement pagination**: Use cursor-based pagination for large datasets
   - **Cache results**: Store frequently accessed customer data
   - **Batch efficiently**: Query multiple customers in single requests when possible

4. **Cost Optimization Examples**:
   ```graphql
   # ❌ HIGH COST - Fetches all customers with excessive fields
   query {
     customers(first: 50) {
       edges {
         node {
           id email firstName lastName phone orders { edges { node { ... } } }
           addresses { ... } tags metafields { ... }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   
   # ✅ LOW COST - Fetches customers with essential fields only
   query {
     customers(first: 10, query:"email:*@example.com") {
       edges {
         node {
           id email firstName lastName
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Query Generation Rules

### Variable Placeholders

When generating customer queries, use these placeholders that will be replaced with actual values:

| Placeholder | Description | Default Value | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| `$CUSTOMER_ID$` | Customer ID | Ask user if not provided | `gid://shopify/Customer/123456789` |
| `$EMAIL$` | Customer email | Ask user if not provided | `"customer@example.com"` |
| `$PHONE$` | Customer phone | Ask user if not provided | `"+1234567890"` |
| `$FIRST_NAME$` | Customer first name | Ask user if not provided | `"John"` |
| `$LAST_NAME$` | Customer last name | Ask user if not provided | `"Doe"` |
| `$TAG$` | Customer tag | Ask user if not provided | `"VIP"` |
| `$LIMIT$` | Number of results | `10` | `25` |
| `$CURSOR$` | Pagination cursor | `null` | `"eyJjb25uZWN0aW9u..."` |
| `$QUERY_STRING$` | Search query string | `""` | `"email:@example.com AND country:United States"` |

### Query Structure Templates

#### Multiple Customers Query Template
```graphql
query customers($first: Int!, $query: String, $after: String) {
  customers(first: $first, query: $query, after: $after) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        email
        firstName
        lastName
        phone
        createdAt
        updatedAt
        tags
        state
        numberOfOrders
        totalSpentV2 {
          amount
          currencyCode
        }
      }
    }
    pageInfo {
      hasNextPage
      endCursor
    }
  }
}
```

#### Specific Customer Query Template
```graphql
query customer($id: ID!) {
  customer(id: $id) {
    id

    firstName
    lastName
    phone
    createdAt

      province
      country
      zip
      phone
    }
    orders(first: 5) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          name
          processedAt
          totalPriceV2 {
            amount
            currencyCode
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Customer Count Query Template
```graphql
query customersCount($query: String) {
  customersCount(query: $query) {
    count
  }
}
```

## Response Guidelines

When generating a customer query for the user:

**Important**: Users are Shopify merchants, not technical developers. Always explain in simple, business-friendly terms.

1. **Explain what the query does** in simple business terms (e.g., "This will find customers matching your criteria")
2. **Explain what information is needed** in simple terms (e.g., "I'll need to know what customers you're looking for")
3. **Explain any limitations** in simple terms (e.g., "This will show up to 50 customers at a time")
4. **Ask for clarification** if requirements are unclear, using business language
5. **Offer practical options** that relate to their business needs
6. **Avoid technical jargon** - no mentions of "cost", "query complexity", "optimization", etc.

### Example Response Format

```
I'll help you find customer information from your store.

**Query:**
```graphql
query customers($first: Int!, $query: String) {
  customers(first: $first, query: $query) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        email
        firstName
        lastName
        phone
        createdAt
        tags
        numberOfOrders
        totalSpentV2 {
          amount
          currencyCode
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**What this does:**
This searches for customers in your store and returns their contact information and order history.

**What I need from you:**
- What specific customers are you looking for? (by email, name, tags, etc.)
- How many customers would you like to see?

**Examples of what you can search for:**
- All customers with a specific email domain
- Customers who placed orders in the last month
- Customers with specific tags (like "VIP" or "wholesale")
- Customers by name or location
