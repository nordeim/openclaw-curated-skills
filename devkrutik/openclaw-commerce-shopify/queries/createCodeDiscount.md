## Rate Limiting Guidelines

**Critical**: Always follow Shopify's rate limiting rules when creating code discounts.

**Documentation**: https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/rate-limits

**Note**: *Review rate limit documentation only when you encounter throttling issues or need to optimize expensive mutations*

### Key Rate Limiting Principles

1. **GraphQL Admin API Rate Limits**:
   - Calculated cost-based system (not simple request count)
   - Each field and connection has a cost
   - Maximum 1000 points per app per store per minute (by default)
   - Restore rate: 50 points per second

2. **Code Discount Creation Cost Calculation**:
   - Code discount creation mutations have moderate to high costs
   - Complex discount rules and conditions increase cost significantly
   - Bulk operations have higher costs but are more efficient than individual operations
   - Formula: `cost = base_mutation_cost + discount_complexity + condition_logic + customer_targeting`

3. **Best Practices for Code Discount Creation Mutation Generation**:
   - **Include only required fields**: Don't add optional fields unless needed
   - **Validate discount logic**: Ensure discount rules make business sense
   - **Use bulk operations**: Create multiple codes in single mutations when possible
   - **Test discount logic**: Validate discount behavior before activation
   - **Consider customer experience**: Design codes for easy customer use

4. **Cost Optimization Examples**:
   ```graphql
   # ❌ HIGH COST - Creates discount with excessive configuration
   mutation discountCodeAppCreate($input: DiscountCodeAppInput!) {
     discountCodeAppCreate(input: $input) {
       discount { id title codes { edges { node { ... } } } 
       customerSelection { ... } discountClass { ... } }
       userErrors { field message }
     }
   }
   
   # ✅ LOW COST - Creates discount with essential fields only
   mutation discountCodeAppCreate($input: DiscountCodeAppInput!) {
     discountCodeAppCreate(input: $input) {
       discount {
         id
         title
         status
         startsAt
         endsAt
       }
       userErrors {
         field
         message
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Mutation Generation Rules

## Response Guidelines

When generating a code discount creation mutation for the user:

**Important**: Users are Shopify merchants, not technical developers. Always explain in simple, business-friendly terms.

1. **Explain what the mutation does** in simple business terms (e.g., "This will create a new discount code for your store")
2. **Explain what information is needed** in simple terms (e.g., "I'll need the discount title, code, and discount amount")
3. **Explain any limitations** in simple terms (e.g., "This creates the discount but you'll need to activate it before customers can use it")
4. **Ask for clarification** if requirements are unclear, using business language
5. **Offer practical options** that relate to their business needs
6. **Avoid technical jargon** - no mentions of "cost", "mutation complexity", "optimization", etc.

### Example Response Format

```
I'll help you create a new discount code for your store.

**Mutation:**
```graphql
mutation discountCodeBasicCreate($input: DiscountCodeBasicInput!) {
  discountCodeBasicCreate(input: $input) {
    discount {
      id
      title
      status
      startsAt
      endsAt
      summary
      codes(first: 5) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            code
            usageCount
          }
        }
      }
    }
    userErrors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```

**What this does:**
This creates a new discount code that customers can use at checkout.

**What I need from you:**
- Discount title and code (e.g., "Summer Sale" and "SUMMER2024")
- Discount type and amount (percentage or fixed amount)
- When the discount should start and end
- Any usage limits or customer restrictions

**Important notes:**
- The discount will be created but may need to be activated
- You can set usage limits to control how many times the code can be used
- Consider who should be able to use the discount (all customers or specific groups)
