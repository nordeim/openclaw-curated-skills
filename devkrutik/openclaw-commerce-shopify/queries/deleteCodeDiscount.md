# Shopify Code Discount Deletion & Management

This guide helps you generate accurate GraphQL mutations for deleting code discounts and managing code discount data removal in Shopify.

## Instructions for Mutation Generation

When a user requests to delete code discounts or manage code discount data removal, follow these steps:

1. **Read and understand** the official Shopify documentation thoroughly
2. **Analyze** the user's specific code discount deletion requirements
3. **Generate** the appropriate GraphQL mutation based on the documentation
4. **Apply** rate limiting best practices
5. **Validate** that all required fields are included in the mutation
6. **Warn about irreversible consequences** - deletion is permanent

## Rate Limiting Guidelines

**Critical**: Always follow Shopify's rate limiting rules when deleting code discounts.

**Documentation**: https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/rate-limits

**Note**: *Review rate limit documentation only when you encounter throttling issues or need to optimize expensive mutations*

### Key Rate Limiting Principles

1. **GraphQL Admin API Rate Limits**:
   - Calculated cost-based system (not simple request count)
   - Each field and connection has a cost
   - Maximum 1000 points per app per store per minute (by default)
   - Restore rate: 50 points per second

2. **Code Discount Delete Cost Calculation**:
   - Code discount deletion mutations have moderate costs
   - Complex discounts with many codes may have higher costs
   - Bulk operations have higher costs but are more efficient than individual operations
   - Formula: `cost = base_mutation_cost + discount_complexity + code_count + usage_data`

3. **Best Practices for Code Discount Delete Mutation Generation**:
   - **Include only required fields**: Don't add optional fields unless needed
   - **Validate eligibility**: Ensure code discount is eligible for deletion before mutation
   - **Handle errors**: Always check for user errors in mutation response
   - **Consider alternatives**: Suggest deactivation instead of deletion when appropriate
   - **Warn about consequences**: Clearly explain irreversible nature of deletion

4. **Cost Optimization Examples**:
   ```graphql
   # ❌ HIGH COST - Deletes discount with excessive return fields
   mutation discountCodeDelete($input: DiscountCodeDeleteInput!) {
     discountCodeDelete(input: $input) {
       deletedDiscountId
       discount { id title codes { ... } usageCount { ... } }
       userErrors { field message }
     }
   }
   
   # ✅ LOW COST - Deletes discount with essential fields only
   mutation discountCodeDelete($input: DiscountCodeDeleteInput!) {
     discountCodeDelete(input: $input) {
       deletedDiscountId
       userErrors { field message }
     }
   }
   ```

## Mutation Generation Rules

### Variable Placeholders

When generating code discount delete mutations, use these placeholders that will be replaced with actual values:

| Placeholder | Description | Default Value | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| `$DISCOUNT_ID$` | Discount ID to delete | Ask user if not provided | `gid://shopify/DiscountNode/123456789` |
| `$DISCOUNT_IDS$` | Discount IDs for bulk operations | Ask user if not provided | `[gid://shopify/DiscountNode/123456789]` |
| `$DELETE_REASON$` | Reason for deletion | `"DISCOUNT_CLEANUP"` | `"SEASONAL_REMOVAL"` |
| `$REDEEM_CODE$` | Code to delete redemption for | Ask user if not provided | `"SUMMER2024"` |
| `$CUSTOMER_IDS$` | Customer IDs for redemption deletion | Ask user if not provided | `[gid://shopify/Customer/987654321]` |

## Response Guidelines

When generating a code discount delete mutation for the user:

**Important**: Users are Shopify merchants, not technical developers. Always explain in simple, business-friendly terms. **CRITICAL**: Always warn about the permanent nature of deletion.

1. **Explain what the mutation does** in simple business terms (e.g., "This will permanently delete the discount code from your store")
2. **Warn about consequences** in clear terms (e.g., "This action cannot be undone - all discount data will be permanently removed")
3. **Explain what information is needed** in simple terms (e.g., "I'll need the discount ID or code")
4. **Explain any limitations** in simple terms (e.g., "Only certain discounts can be deleted - others must be deactivated")
5. **Suggest alternatives** when appropriate (e.g., "Consider deactivating instead of deleting to preserve data")
6. **Ask for confirmation** before proceeding with deletion
7. **Avoid technical jargon** - no mentions of "cost", "mutation complexity", "optimization", etc.

### Example Response Format

```
I'll help you delete a discount code from your store.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT WARNING**: This will permanently delete the discount code and all associated data. This action cannot be undone.

**Mutation:**
```graphql
mutation discountCodeDelete($input: DiscountCodeDeleteInput!) {
  discountCodeDelete(input: $input) {
    deletedDiscountId
    userErrors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```

**What this does:**
This permanently removes a discount code from your Shopify store.

**What I need from you:**
- The discount ID or code you want to delete

**Important consequences:**
- All discount configuration will be permanently erased
- Usage history and analytics will be lost
- Any customers with saved codes will lose access
- Marketing materials referencing the code will become invalid
- This action cannot be reversed

**Alternatives to consider:**
- Deactivate the discount to preserve data and usage history
- Set an early end date instead of deletion
- Archive the discount for future reference
- Update the discount instead of deleting it

**Are you sure you want to proceed with permanent deletion?**
```
