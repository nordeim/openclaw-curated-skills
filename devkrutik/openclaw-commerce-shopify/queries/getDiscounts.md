# Shopify Discount Queries

This guide helps you generate accurate GraphQL queries for fetching discount information from Shopify.

## Instructions for Query Generation

When a user requests to fetch discount data, follow these steps:

1. **Read and understand** the official Shopify documentation thoroughly
2. **Analyze** the user's specific discount data requirements
3. **Generate** the appropriate GraphQL query based on the documentation
4. **Apply** rate limiting best practices
5. **Validate** that all required fields are included in the query

## Rate Limiting Guidelines

**Critical**: Always follow Shopify's rate limiting rules when querying discount data.

**Documentation**: https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/rate-limits

**Note**: *Review rate limit documentation only when you encounter throttling issues or need to optimize expensive queries*

### Key Rate Limiting Principles

1. **GraphQL Admin API Rate Limits**:
   - Calculated cost-based system (not simple request count)
   - Each field and connection has a cost
   - Maximum 1000 points per app per store per minute (by default)
   - Restore rate: 50 points per second

2. **Discount Query Cost Calculation**:
   - Discount queries have moderate costs
   - Complex discounts with many rules increase cost
   - Large result sets require pagination to manage costs
   - Formula: `cost = base_query_cost + discount_complexity + result_size`

3. **Best Practices for Discount Query Generation**:
   - **Include only required fields**: Don't request unnecessary discount data
   - **Use specific filters**: Narrow results to reduce data transfer
   - **Implement pagination**: Use cursor-based pagination for large datasets
   - **Cache results**: Store frequently accessed discount data
   - **Batch efficiently**: Query multiple discounts in single requests when possible

4. **Cost Optimization Examples**:
   ```graphql
   # ❌ HIGH COST - Fetches all discounts with excessive fields
   query {
     discountNodes(first: 50) {
       edges {
         node {
           id title status discountClass { ... } 
           codes { edges { node { ... } } }
           automaticDiscount { ... }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   
   # ✅ LOW COST - Fetches discounts with essential fields only
   query {
     discountNodes(first: 10, query:"status:ACTIVE") {
       edges {
         node {
           id
           title
           status
           discountClass
           startsAt
           endsAt
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Query Generation Rules

### Variable Placeholders

When generating discount queries, use these placeholders that will be replaced with actual values:

| Placeholder | Description | Default Value | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| `$DISCOUNT_ID$` | Discount ID | Ask user if not provided | `gid://shopify/DiscountNode/123456789` |
| `$TITLE$` | Discount title | Ask user if not provided | `"Summer Sale"` |
| `$STATUS$` | Discount status | `"ACTIVE"` | `"ARCHIVED"` |
| `$DISCOUNT_CLASS$` | Discount class | Ask user if not provided | `"CODE"` or `"AUTOMATIC"` |
| `$LIMIT$` | Number of results | `10` | `25` |
| `$CURSOR$` | Pagination cursor | `null` | `"eyJjb25uZWN0aW9u..."` |
| `$QUERY_STRING$` | Search query string | `""` | `"title:Summer AND status:ACTIVE"` |
| `$STARTS_AT$` | Discount start date | Ask user if not provided | `"2024-06-01T00:00:00Z"` |
| `$ENDS_AT$` | Discount end date | Ask user if not provided | `"2024-08-31T23:59:59Z"` |

## Response Guidelines

When generating a discount query for the user:

**Important**: Users are Shopify merchants, not technical developers. Always explain in simple, business-friendly terms.

1. **Explain what the query does** in simple business terms (e.g., "This will find discounts matching your criteria")
2. **Explain what information is needed** in simple terms (e.g., "I'll need to know what discounts you're looking for")
3. **Explain any limitations** in simple terms (e.g., "This will show up to 50 discounts at a time")
4. **Ask for clarification** if requirements are unclear, using business language
5. **Offer practical options** that relate to their business needs
6. **Avoid technical jargon** - no mentions of "cost", "query complexity", "optimization", etc.
