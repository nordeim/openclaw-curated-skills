# Shopify Catalog Deletion

This guide helps you generate accurate GraphQL mutations for deleting catalogs and managing catalog data removal in Shopify.

## Instructions for Mutation Generation

When a user requests to delete catalogs or manage catalog data removal, follow these steps:

1. **Read and understand** the official Shopify documentation thoroughly
2. **Analyze** the user's specific catalog deletion requirements
3. **Generate** the appropriate GraphQL mutation based on the documentation
4. **Apply** rate limiting best practices
5. **Validate** that all required fields are included in the mutation
6. **Warn about irreversible consequences** - deletion is permanent

## Official Documentation

### Primary Catalog Delete Documentation
**Primary Reference**: https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/catalogDelete

**What to learn from this documentation:**
- Required input fields for catalog deletion
- Catalog eligibility requirements for deletion
- Product and collection data implications
- Catalog deletion workflows and consequences
- Multi-storefront impact considerations

**Important sections to review:**
- Input fields: https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/catalogDelete#argument-input
  - *Review only when you need to verify required fields or find new input options*
- Return fields: https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/catalogDelete#return-fields
  - *Review only when you need to verify what data is returned after deletion*
- Examples: https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/catalogDelete#examples
  - *Review only when you need sample mutation patterns for deletion scenarios*

## Rate Limiting Guidelines

**Critical**: Always follow Shopify's rate limiting rules when deleting catalogs.

**Documentation**: https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/rate-limits

**Note**: *Review rate limit documentation only when you encounter throttling issues or need to optimize expensive mutations*

### Key Rate Limiting Principles

1. **GraphQL Admin API Rate Limits**:
   - Calculated cost-based system (not simple request count)
   - Each field and connection has a cost
   - Maximum 1000 points per app per store per minute (by default)
   - Restore rate: 50 points per second

2. **Catalog Delete Cost Calculation**:
   - Catalog deletion mutations have moderate costs
   - Complex catalogs with many products may have higher costs
   - Publication and market settings add complexity
   - Formula: `cost = base_mutation_cost + catalog_complexity + product_count`

3. **Best Practices for Catalog Delete Mutation Generation**:
   - **Include only required fields**: Don't add optional fields unless needed
   - **Validate eligibility**: Ensure catalog is eligible for deletion before mutation
   - **Handle errors**: Always check for user errors in mutation response
   - **Consider alternatives**: Suggest archiving instead of deletion when appropriate
   - **Warn about consequences**: Clearly explain irreversible nature of deletion

4. **Cost Optimization Examples**:
   ```graphql
   # ❌ HIGH COST - Deletes catalog with excessive return fields
   mutation catalogDelete($input: CatalogDeleteInput!) {
     catalogDelete(input: $input) {
       deletedCatalogId
       catalog { id name products { ... } collections { ... } }
       userErrors { field message }
     }
   }
   
   # ✅ LOW COST - Deletes catalog with essential fields only
   mutation catalogDelete($input: CatalogDeleteInput!) {
     catalogDelete(input: $input) {
       deletedCatalogId
       userErrors { field message }
     }
   }
   ```

## Mutation Generation Rules

### Variable Placeholders

When generating catalog delete mutations, use these placeholders that will be replaced with actual values:

| Placeholder | Description | Default Value | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| `$CATALOG_ID$` | Catalog ID to delete | Ask user if not provided | `gid://shopify/Catalog/123456789` |
| `$DELETE_REASON$` | Reason for deletion | `"CATALOG_CLEANUP"` | `"STORE_REORGANIZATION"` |

### Mutation Structure Templates

#### Catalog Delete Template
```graphql
mutation catalogDelete($input: CatalogDeleteInput!) {
  catalogDelete(input: $input) {
    deletedCatalogId
    userErrors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```

## Response Guidelines

When generating a catalog delete mutation for the user:

**Important**: Users are Shopify merchants, not technical developers. Always explain in simple, business-friendly terms. **CRITICAL**: Always warn about the permanent nature of deletion.

1. **Explain what the mutation does** in simple business terms (e.g., "This will permanently delete the catalog from your store")
2. **Warn about consequences** in clear terms (e.g., "This action cannot be undone - all catalog data will be permanently removed")
3. **Explain what information is needed** in simple terms (e.g., "I'll need the catalog ID or name")
4. **Explain any limitations** in simple terms (e.g., "Only certain catalogs can be deleted - others must be archived")
5. **Suggest alternatives** when appropriate (e.g., "Consider archiving instead of deleting to preserve data")
6. **Ask for confirmation** before proceeding with deletion
7. **Avoid technical jargon** - no mentions of "cost", "mutation complexity", "optimization", etc.

### Example Response Format

```
I'll help you delete a catalog from your store.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT WARNING**: This will permanently delete the catalog and all associated data. This action cannot be undone.

**Mutation:**
```graphql
mutation catalogDelete($input: CatalogDeleteInput!) {
  catalogDelete(input: $input) {
    deletedCatalogId
    userErrors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```

**What this does:**
This permanently removes a catalog from your Shopify store.

**What I need from you:**
- The catalog ID or name you want to delete

**Important consequences:**
- All catalog configuration will be permanently erased
- Products and collections may be affected
- Publication settings will be lost
- Market configurations may be impacted
- This action cannot be reversed

**Alternatives to consider:**
- Archive the catalog to preserve configuration
- Deactivate the catalog to hide it temporarily
- Reorganize products instead of deleting the catalog

**Are you sure you want to proceed with permanent deletion?**
```
