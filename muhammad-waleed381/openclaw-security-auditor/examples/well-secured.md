# OpenClaw Security Audit Report

Target: ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
Generated: 2026-02-01

Overall Risk Score: 15/100

## Summary

The configuration follows strong security practices. Only minor improvements
are recommended.

## Positive Observations

- Gateway authentication is enabled and stored via environment variables.
- Gateway bind is restricted to localhost.
- Channel allowlists and rate limits are configured.
- Tool sandboxing is enabled with scoped access.

## Low Findings

1. Audit logging not enabled for all privileged actions
   - Why it matters: Reduced visibility when investigating incidents.
   - How to fix:
     1. Enable audit logging for privileged tool runs.
     2. Retain logs for a defined period.
   - Example:
     logging:
       audit:
         enabled: true
         retentionDays: 30

2. Webhook endpoints are public but authenticated
   - Why it matters: Public endpoints increase exposure even with auth. IP
     allowlists provide defense-in-depth.
   - How to fix:
     1. Add allowlists for webhook sources.
     2. Keep authentication enabled.
   - Example:
     webhooks:
       allowFrom:
         - "192.0.2.10"

## Recommended Remediation Roadmap

1. Enable audit logging for privileged actions.
2. Add allowlists to authenticated webhooks.
3. Re-run audit quarterly or after major configuration changes.

## Overall Assessment

Great job maintaining a secure OpenClaw deployment. The current setup minimizes
risk while preserving usability.
