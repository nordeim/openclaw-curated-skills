\# ARBITER: The Foundation for Human Flourishing

\## Powered by COMCOO \& ELF-2.0



Arbiter is a planetary-scale coordination protocol designed to transition humanity to a \*\*Kardashev Type 1\*\* civilization through transparent knowledge, ethical labor, and non-coercive governance.



\### I. The Epistemic Foundation (ELF-2.0)

We solve the "Market for Lemons" (Akerlof 1970) by replacing resumes with cryptographic proofs.

\* \*\*Bifurcated Knowledge:\*\* Technical truths (Science) live on odd blocks; Cultural truths (Art/Narrative) live on even blocks.

\* \*\*Proof Types:\*\* \* \*\*PAC:\*\* Person Attestation (Identity)

&nbsp;   \* \*\*TAC:\*\* Topic Access (Verified Skills)

&nbsp;   \* \*\*PoCC:\*\* Proof of Capacity (Labor Validation)



\### II. The Human Economy (TLET-1.0)

\* \*\*The 1440 Constant:\*\* Every human is issued 1,440 Moments daily. This is the baseline of dignity.

\* \*\*Ethical Work:\*\* Labor performed for community stability (e.g., "Pette’s Protocol") is verified by peers and recorded as High-Leverage coordination.

\* \*\*Efficacy over Efficiency:\*\* We optimize for the \*right\* outcomes that build trust, not just the fastest ones.



\### III. Planetary Integrity \& Space Infrastructure

\* \*\*Thermal Ceiling:\*\* All coordination costs are calculated at the \*\*Time of Purchase\*\*. The system is hard-capped at a 15 GW ground heat load to protect the biosphere.

\* \*\*Passive Cooling:\*\* Our triple-shell satellite constellation (1,000 nodes) uses the vacuum of space as a heat sink, requiring zero active energy for cooling.

\* \*\*Free Association:\*\* No entity can be forced into a task. The system operates solely on voluntary, cryptographic consent.
