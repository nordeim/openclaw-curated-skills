# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:

- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## Examples

```markdown
### Cameras

- living-room → Main area, 180° wide angle
- front-door → Entrance, motion-triggered

### SSH

- home-server → 192.168.1.100, user: admin

### TTS

- Preferred voice: "Nova" (warm, slightly British)
- Default speaker: Kitchen HomePod
```

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.

## 🛠️ Installed Skills Quick Reference

### System
- **healthcheck** - Security audits and system hardening
- **skill-creator** - Create and package new skills

## 🦞 Proactive Agent Tool Tips

### When to Spawn Sub-agents
- Research tasks that need web search + analysis
- Tasks that can run in parallel
- Long-running operations that shouldn't block main session

### When to Use Cron vs Heartbeat
- **Heartbeat** (every ~30 min): Batch checks (email + calendar + notifications)
- **Cron** (exact time): Precise schedules, one-shot reminders, isolated background tasks

### Tool Migration Checklist
When deprecating tools, update:
- [ ] Cron jobs
- [ ] Scripts in `scripts/`
- [ ] Docs (TOOLS.md, HEARTBEAT.md, AGENTS.md)
- [ ] Skills referencing the tool
- [ ] Templates and examples

## 🔍 Finding Past Context

When looking for something:
1. `memory_search("query")` - semantic search daily notes + MEMORY.md
2. Check `memory/working-buffer.md` - recent exchanges in danger zone
3. `SESSION-STATE.md` - active task state
4. grep fallback for exact matches
