justfinethanku/nate-jones-second-brain/SKILL.md:description: Set up and operate a personal knowledge system using Supabase (pgvector) and OpenRouter. Five structured tables — thoughts (inbox log), people, projects, ideas, admin — with AI-powered classification, confidence-based routing, and semantic search across all categories. Captures thoughts from any source, classifies them via LLM, routes them to the right table (the Sorter), rejects low-confidence classifications (the Bouncer), and logs everything (the Receipt). Two opinionated primitives — Supabase for persistent context architecture, OpenRouter as the AI gateway — that unlock unlimited applications on top. The foundation layer for a personal knowledge system. By Limited Edition Jonathan • natebjones.com
