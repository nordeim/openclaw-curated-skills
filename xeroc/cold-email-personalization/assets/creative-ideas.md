# Creative Ideas Campaign Generation

## What Is This?
The Creative Ideas campaign shows 3 specific ideas of how you'd help THEIR company.
- **Shows > Tells**: Demonstrates capability.
- **Tailored**: Not a template.
- **Low commitment**: Just evaluating ideas.

## The Critical Constraint: Feature-Box Your Ideas
**The Problem**: Unconstrained AI hallucinates capabilities.
**The Solution**: Define 3-5 specific features you ACTUALLY offer, then generate ideas using ONLY those features.

### Step 1: Define Your Constraint Box
List 3-5 specific features/capabilities.
*Example (Marketing Agency):*
1. Paid social ads
2. SEO content creation
3. Email marketing automation

### Step 2: Research Their Company (5-7 min)
Look for:
- What they sell
- Current approach
- Gaps/opportunities
- Competitor landscape

### Step 3: Generate Ideas (One Per Feature)
Formula: `[Action verb] + [Feature from constraint box] + [Specific to their company] + [Why it would help]`

*Example:*
> • Paid social campaign targeting sales leaders using LinkedIn's "job function" targeting—would help with reaching decision-makers directly.

### Step 4: Format the Email
**Subject**: "Marketing ideas", "Quick ideas"
**Opening**: "I was back on your site today and had some ideas..."
**Ideas**: 3 bullet points.
**Disclaimer**: "But of course, I wrote this without knowing anything about your current bottlenecks..."
**CTA**: "If it's interesting, we could hop on a call..."

## Quality Check
- ✅ Each idea uses ONE feature from your constraint box?
- ✅ Each idea is specific to THEIR company?
- ✅ Each idea explains the benefit?
- ✅ Disclaimer included?
