# Follow-Up Email Sequences

## Philosophy
- **Email 1 (Day 0)**: Full campaign (Custom signal / Whole offer).
- **Email 2 (Day 3-4)**: Threaded. Rotate value prop.
- **Email 3 (Day 7-8)**: New thread. Different angle. Drop AI?
- **Email 4 (Day 11-12)**: Final. Redirect or Resource offer.

## The "3 Offers" Framework
1. **Save time** (efficiency)
2. **Save money** (ROI)
3. **Make money** (revenue)

**Strategy**: If Email 1 was "Save Time", Email 2 should be "Make Money".

## Email 2: Rotate Value Prop (Threaded)
**Subject**: NONE (threads to Email 1).
**Templates**:
- **Creative Ideas**: "Had some ideas for you..."
- **Stats/Data Hook**: "Our system combines 40 databases..."
- **Industry Insights**: "Seeing changes in the {{industry}} environment..."

## Email 3: New Thread, Different Angle
**Subject**: NEW subject line.
**Strategy**: Consider dropping AI personalization. Go direct.
**Templates**:
- **Expertise Hook**: "We've helped hundreds of customers..."
- **Whole Offer (Reset)**: Direct problem → solution → proof.
- **Case Study Deep Dive**: Story format.

## Email 4: Final Email
**Strategy**: Redirect or Resource.
**Path A (Redirect)**: "Let me know if {{employee_1}} or {{employee_2}} would be better..."
**Path B (Resources)**: "If you're busy, we have resources on [topic]..."
**Path C (Value Bomb)**: "I pulled these contacts for you..."
