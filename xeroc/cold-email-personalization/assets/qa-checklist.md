# QA Checklist: Ship-Ready Email Standards

## 1. Personalization Quality
- ✅ First line references a specific signal (Custom research, AI insight, or Whole-offer).
- ✅ No hallucinations (Every fact verifiable).
- ✅ Variables properly formatted (`{{double_braces}}`).

## 2. Banned Phrases (Delete These)
- ❌ "I hope this email finds you well"
- ❌ "I wanted to reach out"
- ❌ "We help companies..." (unless followed by proof)
- ❌ "Can I get 15 minutes?"

## 3. Recipient:Sender Ratio
- Count sentences about THEM vs US.
- **Target ratio: 3:1 minimum.**

## 4. Length & Punchiness Check
- **Target: 50-90 words.**
- **The 20-Second Rule**: Read aloud. If >20s, cut.
- **Cut fluff**: "I was wondering if", "innovative solution".

## 5. CTA Quality
- ✅ **Low-effort reply test**: Can they reply in 5 words or less?
- ✅ **Value-exchange**: "...so I can show you [example]"
- ❌ **Bad**: "Let me know your thoughts", "Schedule 15 mins".

## 6. Tone & Clarity
- ✅ Reads naturally aloud.
- ✅ Helpful, confident, conversational.
- ✅ Clear value proposition.

## 7. Punctuation & Formatting
- ✅ Em dashes consistent ("—").
- ✅ No double spaces.
- ✅ Plain text (no bold/italics).

## 8. Subject Line Check
- ✅ 2-4 words ("Partnership?", "Quick question") OR Whole offer.
- ❌ No "Quick question about your infrastructure" (too long/salesy).

## 9. Case Study Check
- ✅ Specific metric ("4.7x increase").
- ✅ Timeframe ("within 90 days").
- ✅ Customer type ("Series B SaaS").

## 10. The "Would I Reply?" Test
Ask honestly:
1. Do they understand MY situation?
2. Is there a non-obvious insight?
3. Is it low-effort to reply?
4. Is there a reason to engage NOW?

**If NO to any → Rewrite.**
