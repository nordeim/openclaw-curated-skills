# Email Structure & Strategy

## Subject Line Strategy

### Approach A: 2-4 Words (Intrigue)
Best when using custom research signals.
- "Partnership?"
- "Quick question"
- "Competitor insights"
- "Saw your post"

**Test:** Can a colleague send this? If yes, good.

### Approach B: Whole Offer in Subject + Preview
Best when data is limited or offer is self-selecting.
- Subject: "Ever chase renters to pay on time?"
- Preview: "We built a platform that rewards renters for paying on time..."

## Email Body Structure
Target: 50-90 words.

### Line 1: Situation Recognition (1 sentence)
Describe THEIR exact situation. Be direct.
- ✅ "Saw you posted about {{ai_generation}}—seems like it was {{days_ago}} days since the one before that."
- ❌ "I hope this email finds you well!"

### Line 2: Value Prop + Proof (1-2 sentences MAX)
What you do + metric. No fluff.
- ✅ "We helped companies like Lemlist double down on social with our scheduling tool."
- ✅ "We've attributed a 4.7x increase in upgrades after adding product videos."

### Optional: The "Specifically" Line
> "Specifically, it looks like you're trying to sell to {{customer_type}}, and we can help with that."

### Line 3: Low-Effort CTA (1 sentence)
Binary question or simple offer.
- ✅ "Worth a look?"
- ✅ "Could I send you access?"

## How to Make Emails Punchier

### The Cutting Process
1. **Delete fluff**: "I hope this finds you well", "I wanted to reach out", "innovative solutions".
2. **Compress sentences**: Replace clauses with periods. "We built a platform that can do X" → "We do X".
3. **Cut adjectives**: Keep only data-backed adjectives ("4.7x", "Series B").

### Quick Compression Tactics
- **Kill intro phrases**: Just start with the point.
- **Use em dashes**: "Saw your post—noticed it was..."
- **Delete "that" and "which"**: "We pull everyone engaging..."
- **Active voice always**.
- **Numbers > words**: "30 days" not "thirty days".
- **Abbreviate where clear**: "vs.", "CRO".

### The 50-Word Challenge
Can you say it in 50 words without losing the situation, value prop, proof, or CTA? Usually, yes.
