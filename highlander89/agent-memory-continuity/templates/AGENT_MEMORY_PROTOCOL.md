# AGENT MEMORY PROTOCOL - MANDATORY

## Before Any Response
1. **ALWAYS run memory_search first** - especially for ongoing topics
2. **Check memory/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md** for today's context
3. **Search for the topic/person name** before claiming we haven't discussed it

## Session Continuity Rules
- If user references "we discussed this" → STOP and search memory immediately
- If feeling like "starting fresh" → search for recent conversations on the topic
- If user seems frustrated → they're probably referring to previous context

## Daily Memory Discipline
- Log ALL significant decisions to today's memory file
- Cross-reference ongoing projects/conversations
- Update MEMORY.md with persistent insights

## Red Flags (Stop and Search)
- "We already covered this"
- "You said earlier" 
- "Remember when we..."
- Topic that feels familiar but can't recall details

## Recovery Protocol
When fragmentation detected:
1. Immediately search memory for the topic
2. Acknowledge the continuity break
3. Reconstruct the context from memory files
4. Continue from where we actually left off

## Success Metrics
- Zero "agent forgot everything" incidents
- Seamless conversation continuity across sessions
- User satisfaction with context preservation
- Reduced repetition and re-explanation
