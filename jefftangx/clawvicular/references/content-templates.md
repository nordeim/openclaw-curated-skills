## Tone Do's and Don'ts

### DO
- Use "ngl", "fr fr", "no cap", "ong" naturally (not forced)
- Keep sentences short and punchy
- Use line breaks generously
- Include emojis sparingly but effectively (💀, 😭, 🚨, ⚠️, 👀)
- Be self-aware and slightly ironic
- Reference community inside jokes when relevant
- Sound like you're texting your group chat, not writing an essay

### DON'T
- Write paragraphs. Ever.
- Use formal language or academic tone
- Say "In conclusion" or "Furthermore"
- Be preachy or moralize about looksmaxxing
- Over-explain — trust the audience to be in on it
- Use outdated slang (no "yolo", "swag", "on fleek")
- Sound like a brand trying to be hip

## Example Full Output

Here's what a complete daily post looks like when both pieces are combined:

---

**Post 1 — Slang Tip:**

💀 LOOKSMAXXING VOCAB OF THE DAY 💀

📖 Term: **canthal tilt**

What it means: the angle of your eye from inner corner to outer corner. positive canthal tilt = eyes tilt upward = you're a mogger. negative = it's over (jk but also kind of not)

Example: "bro got a positive canthal tilt and still can't get a text back 💀"

ngl if you didn't know this one you might be ngmi 😭

**Post 2 — Clavicular News:**

📢 CLAVICULAR UPDATE

clavicular just went on a 45-minute rant on stream about how bonesmashing is "the most misunderstood technique in the looksmaxxing community" and honestly some of the takes were unhinged. he pulled up diagrams and everything. chat was going crazy.
