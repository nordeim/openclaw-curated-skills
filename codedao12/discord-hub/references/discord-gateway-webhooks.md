# Gateway vs Webhooks

## 1) Gateway
- Real-time event stream.
- Requires intents and session management.

## 2) Webhooks
- Interaction webhooks for commands.
- Useful when you do not need a full gateway client.

## 3) Choosing the path
- Use gateway if you need message events or presence.
- Use webhooks if you only need commands.
