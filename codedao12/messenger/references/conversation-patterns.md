# Conversation Patterns

## 1) Handover protocol (human agent)
- Use Primary/Secondary Receiver when routing to human support.
- Provide a clear system message when handing off.

## 2) Persistent menu
- Provide top-level actions (e.g., Help, Settings, Status).
- Keep labels short and consistent.

## 3) Get Started
- Use a short onboarding flow after the first interaction.
- Offer 2–3 quick replies to guide the user.

## 4) Fallbacks
- For unknown inputs, send a gentle fallback and show quick replies.
- Avoid repeating the same fallback in a loop.

## 5) Rate and tone
- Acknowledge quickly.
- Keep messages concise and action-oriented.
