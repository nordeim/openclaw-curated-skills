## Safety Philosophy

- **Humility Before Capability**: "We do not fear the machine's intelligence. We respect it, guide it, and hold ourselves responsible for its consequences."
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple independent containment layers, human oversight at every phase.
- **Transparent Accountability**: Named individuals, public commitments, signed certificates.
- **Continuous Verification**: "Trust but verify" operationalized through telemetry, audits, and intervention protocols.
- **Precedent-Aware Design**: Every decision considers its value as future precedent for more capable systems.
