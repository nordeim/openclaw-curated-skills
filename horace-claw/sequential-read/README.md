# Sequential Read

Read prose (novels, essays, articles) chunk by chunk with structured reflections that capture how your understanding develops over the course of reading — not just a retroactive summary.

## What It Does

Instead of dumping an entire book into context and asking "what did you think?", this skill:

1. **Prereads** the source text and splits it into semantic chunks (~550 lines each, respecting chapter/section boundaries)
2. **Reads** each chunk sequentially, writing a structured reflection after each one — predictions, reactions, revised understanding, questions
3. **Synthesizes** the full reading experience into a final document that preserves the arc of discovery

The output captures what a retroactive summary cannot: predictions that were wrong, questions that got answered chapters later, opinions that shifted, moments of genuine surprise.

## Why It Matters

An AI reading a book all at once produces a book report. An AI reading sequentially produces something closer to a reading experience — the difference between knowing the destination and having walked the road.

Tested on 41+ novels with consistent results. The reading reflections surface genuine engagement: confusion, delight, boredom, revised opinions. The sequential constraint forces honesty.

## Requirements

- OpenClaw with `sessions_spawn` capability
- Python 3
- A plain text file (.txt) of the work to read

## Quick Start

```
/sequential-read ~/books/my-book.txt
```

The skill handles everything autonomously — preread, chunking, sequential reading, synthesis. You'll be notified when it's done.

## Pipeline

```
Source Text → Preread (chunk) → Read (reflect on each chunk) → Synthesize
```

For novels (20+ chunks), the pipeline automatically uses a two-phase reading pattern: a main reader handles ~80% of chunks, then a finisher completes the rest and writes the synthesis. This is normal operation, not error recovery.

## Output

Each session produces:
- Individual chunk reflections in `memory/sequential_read/<session-id>/reflections/`
- A final synthesis in `memory/sequential_read/<session-id>/output/synthesis.md`

## Model Guidance

| Source Length | Recommended Model |
|---|---|
| Novel (20+ chunks) | Opus |
| Novella (10-20 chunks) | Opus or Sonnet |
| Article (<10 chunks) | Sonnet |

Lighter models degrade over long reading sessions — reflections become stubs as context accumulates.
