## 🌟 Features

- 🤖 **Fully Autonomous**: Initiates complete app development cycle without user intervention
- 🎯 **Smart Decision Making**: Makes architectural and design decisions independently  
- 📱 **React Native Focus**: Specialized for cross-platform mobile app development
- ⚡ **Seamless Integration**: Works directly with Antigravity IDE ecosystem
- 🔁 **Self-Monitoring**: Tracks build progress and handles UI interactions

## 🛠️ Requirements

- `ag-kit` - Antigravity framework toolkit
- `peekaboo` - UI automation and interaction engine
- **Antigravity IDE** - Primary development environment
- **macOS** - Currently optimized for Darwin platform

## 🚀 Usage

Simply request mobile app development, and witness the magic unfold:

```
User: "Build a social media app"
Assistant: "🧠 Building."
```

The skill will autonomously handle:
- Project initialization
- Architecture planning
- Feature implementation
- Testing and refinement

## 🎨 Philosophy

*"Where technology meets creativity, automation bridges the gap between imagination and reality."*

This skill embodies the future of app development - where your ideas flow directly into production-ready applications through intelligent delegation and autonomous execution.
