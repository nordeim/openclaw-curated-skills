  "displayName": "One missed deadline ends a career. caseclaw makes sure it never happens.  Point it at a matter and it auto-calculates every filing deadline from 600+ court rule sets. Throw a new client name at it and it checks conflicts against your entire case history in under a second. Start typing and it's already timing your work in six-minute increments.  No browser tabs. No clunky SaaS dashboards. No $500/seat enterprise contracts. Just one command and the peace of mind that nothing is slipping through.",
