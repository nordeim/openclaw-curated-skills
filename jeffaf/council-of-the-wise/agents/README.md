# Council Agents

Drop `.md` files here to add council members. They're auto-discovered.

## Adding an Agent

1. Create `YourAgent.md` with the agent's persona, voice, and approach
2. Update `../SKILL.md` output format section to add emoji and display order

That's it. The council will include your new agent on the next run.
