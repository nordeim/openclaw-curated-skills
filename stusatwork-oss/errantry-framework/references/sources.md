## Timeline Evidence (NME ↔ AI Hardware)

| Year | Young Wizards | AI/Hardware |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| 2012 | NME updates begin | AlexNet / Deep learning explosion |
| 2016 | *Games Wizards Play* / Full NME rollout | Timeline cemented |
| 2017 | Mobile Manual canonical | Transformer paper / First mobile NPUs (A11, Kirin 970) |

The Manual shifted to low-power, high-efficiency architecture exactly when the field realized AGI requires specialized, energy-efficient hardware.
