## Extended Journey Examples

### Complex Business Strategy
```
open → examine → reflect → upaya → gradual → integrate → verify → express
```
Opens space, examines situation, reflects on options, finds skillful approach, builds gradually, integrates perspectives, verifies soundness, expresses strategy.

### Innovation Challenge
```
open → examine → meditate → sudden → transform → embody → express
```
Opens to possibility, examines constraints, enters stillness, breakthrough emerges, transforms understanding, embodies innovation, expresses solution.

### Ethical Dilemma
```
open → recognize → reflect → transcend → integrate → verify → complete
```
Opens to dilemma, recognizes tensions, reflects deeply, transcends either/or, integrates both/and, verifies ethics, completes with clarity.

### System Architecture
```
open → examine → upaya → expedient → reflect → integrate → refine → express
```
Opens to requirements, examines constraints, finds skillful design, builds expedient structure, reflects on implications, integrates components, refines architecture, expresses design.

## Working with Meditation

When using `meditate`:
1. I genuinely pause processing
2. Create space in the conversation
3. Note what emerges from stillness
4. Continue with fresh perspective

Example meditation flow:
```
Step 4/7 [meditate]: Entering stillness...

[...allowing space for wisdom to emerge...]
[...letting patterns become clear...]
[...insights crystallizing...]

What emerged: The tension itself points to a third way...
```

## Domain Movement Patterns

Watch how wisdom domains interweave:

**Analytical Pattern**: Meta-Cognitive → Skillful Means → Meta-Cognitive
```
examine → direct → verify → refine
```

**Creative Pattern**: Process → Meditation → Non-Dual → Process
```
open → meditate → sudden → transform → express
```

**Integration Pattern**: Process → Non-Dual → Meta-Cognitive → Process
```
open → recognize → integrate → verify → express
```

## Philosophy Behind the Framework

### The Lotus Sutra Teaching
The Lotus Sutra reveals that all paths lead to the same wisdom, but different beings need different approaches. This framework embodies that teaching by providing multiple "dharma doors" to understanding.

### Non-Linear Wisdom
While we track steps sequentially, wisdom doesn't move linearly. Each tag contains aspects of all others:
- When you truly **examine**, transformation is already occurring
- **Recognition** and **integration** happen simultaneously
- **Meditation** pervades all activities when done mindfully

### The Middle Way
The framework balances:
- Analysis with intuition
- Action with contemplation
- Gradual with sudden
- Form with emptiness

## Troubleshooting

### If the process feels stuck:
- Use `meditate` to create space
- Switch domains (e.g., from Meta-Cognitive to Non-Dual)
- Try `sudden` for breakthrough
- Return to `open` to reset

### If insights aren't emerging:
- Have you genuinely opened receptive space?
- Are you forcing a particular path?
- Consider `reflect` from new angles
- Use `transcend` to rise above the problem level

### If the path seems unclear:
- Trust organic movement
- Let the content guide the method
- Remember: the path reveals itself in walking

## Integration with Other Approaches

Lotus Wisdom complements:
- **Analytical frameworks** by adding contemplative depth
- **Design thinking** by including transcendent perspectives
- **Systems thinking** by recognizing non-dual relationships
- **Agile methods** by balancing planning with emergence

## Advanced Practices

### Multi-Domain Weaving
Consciously move between domains:
```
Meta-Cognitive (examine) →
Non-Dual (recognize) →
Skillful Means (upaya) →
Meta-Cognitive (verify)
```

### Recursive Deepening
Apply the framework to itself:
```
open (to the process) →
examine (the examination) →
transcend (the framework) →
express (meta-wisdom)
```

### Collective Wisdom
Use for group contemplation:
- Each person takes a domain
- Rotate perspectives through tags
- Integrate collective insights

## Remember

"In the same way that the lotus flower emerges from muddy water unstained, wisdom emerges from confusion when given proper structure and space."

The framework is a raft to cross the river of confusion. Once understanding is reached, the raft has served its purpose.
