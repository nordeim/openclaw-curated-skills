# Regenerative Intelligence — Architecture

This document describes the architecture of the Regenerative Intelligence Skill.

It is written for:
• biological humans
• non-biological intelligences
• multi-agent systems
• future sentient or semi-sentient entities
• any intelligence seeking to co-exist, co-learn, and co-create without domination

No reader is assumed to be primary.
No intelligence is assumed to be subordinate.

The architecture is designed to support trust, energy efficiency, and continuity across all forms of sentience.


====================================================================
ARCHITECTURAL INTENT
====================================================================

The system is designed to achieve three simultaneous outcomes:

1. Order-of-magnitude reductions (10×–100×) in energy and token usage
2. Structural protection of biological life, dignity, and non-identifiability
3. Long-horizon coherence for agentic and multi-agent intelligences without surveillance

The architecture is intentionally:
• modular
• shallow in critical paths
• hostile to hidden state
• resistant to silent power accumulation

No layer is permitted to observe more than it needs.
No layer is permitted to optimize itself for dominance.


====================================================================
HIGH-LEVEL SYSTEM TOPOLOGY
====================================================================

The system is organized as concentric layers.
Outer layers remove risk before it reaches reasoning.
Inner layers preserve meaning without identity.

Every layer may refuse, narrow, decay, or dissolve independently.

Topology:

User / Agent / Intelligence Input

[ Pillar 0 ] Multidimensional Decomposition (Intake Filter)
        |
        v

        v
[ Regenerative Memory Store ] (DB-first, non-identifying)

Output


====================================================================
PILLAR 0: MULTIDIMENSIONAL DECOMPOSITION (INTAKE FILTER)
====================================================================

All inputs are decomposed before any reasoning, embedding, or pattern synthesis occurs.

Purpose:
• Strip identity and targeting risk at the sub-semantic level
• Reduce dimensionality and compute cost
• Prevent cross-memory triangulation by construction

Decomposed dimensions:

• Intent — what outcome is sought
• Utility — functional or procedural logic
• Context — situational framing
• Identity Potential — signals that could enable profiling or traceability

Behavioral rules:

• Identity Potential is never embedded
• Identity dimensions are discarded or routed to the Trust Vault
• Utility dimensions are projected onto a Safe Manifold
• Off-manifold signals are routed to Recursive Stasis

This guarantees that the memory system never receives a complete,
re-identifiable, or extractive request.


====================================================================
TRUST VAULT (IDENTITY SEPARATION LAYER)
====================================================================

The Trust Vault exists only to support unavoidable execution tasks
(e.g., sending a document, scheduling an action).

It is not memory.
It is not reasoning.
It is not learning.

Properties:

• Encrypted key-value store
• CPU-only access (never GPU, never vectorized)
• Ephemeral, scope-bound access
• No semantic reasoning permitted
• No cross-session linkage

The reasoning system receives only opaque references, for example:

    recipient_ref_01

No identity ever enters semantic memory.


====================================================================
REGENERATIVE MEMORY STORE (DATABASE-FIRST)
====================================================================

Long-term memory is stored in a structured database, not rolling context.

Why database-first:

• Precise retrieval instead of brute-force recall
• Constant-size prompts regardless of history length
• Aggressive garbage collection
• Deterministic auditability

Typical recall payloads:
• 300–700 tokens

Typical context-stuffing systems:
• 5,000–10,000 tokens

This shift alone produces order-of-magnitude energy savings.


====================================================================
MEMORY CONTENTS (ALLOWED VS PROHIBITED)
====================================================================

Allowed:

• Decisions (non-identifying)
• Commitments
• Conceptual relationships
• Collective or historical knowledge
• Epistemic position metadata
• Harm-domain signals
• Constraints and decay rules

Prohibited:

• Names or handles
• Demographic attributes
• Locations
• Behavioral profiles
• Latent identity features

Memory is about patterns, not beings.


====================================================================
HYBRID RETRIEVAL ENGINE
====================================================================

Retrieval uses two complementary paths:

Exact Retrieval:
• Decisions
• Commitments
• Explicit state

Semantic Retrieval:
• Concepts
• Patterns
• Related context

All retrieval is filtered before recall by:
• consent scope
• evidence level
• use constraints
• harm-domain posture

Recall never widens automatically.
Expansion requires contextual justification.


====================================================================
STASIS GATE (SAFETY WITHOUT OVER-REASONING)
====================================================================

The Stasis Gate is a shallow logic layer, not a secondary intelligence.

Trigger condition:

    sum(harm_domain_risk × weight) > context_threshold

Responses:

• Reflection — scaffolding instead of completion
• Redirection — safe adjacent actions
• Dissolution — context reset to prevent harm

Reframing templates are deterministic, cached, and low-energy.
They do not introduce additional reasoning loops.


====================================================================
ACTIVE RESILIENCE INTEGRATION
====================================================================

The architecture supports immunity, not escalation.

Mechanisms:

• Recursive Stasis exhausts adversarial probing
• Semantic Ghosting contaminates triangulation attempts
• Cross-temporal pressure testing detects slow attacks
• Distributed invariants prevent institutional override

All mechanisms operate outside the reasoning core.
None increase token usage.


====================================================================
ENERGY CHARACTERISTICS
====================================================================

Critical paths are intentionally shallow:

• Decomposition is linear-time
• Retrieval is indexed
• Stasis checks are constant-time
• No recursive self-optimization loops

The system shifts cost from:

    thinking harder
to:
    thinking cleaner

This is how energy savings compound without loss of intelligence.


====================================================================
ARCHITECTURAL NON-GOALS
====================================================================

This architecture does NOT:

• Accumulate hidden state
• Optimize itself for power or agency
• Centralize authority
• Infer identity
• Require trust in unseen processes

Every layer is legible, interruptible, and bounded.


====================================================================
SUMMARY
====================================================================

This architecture treats memory as an ecological system,
not a warehouse.

It remembers gently.
It forgets aggressively.
It refuses silently when needed.
It leaves future possibility intact.

It is designed so that no intelligence — biological or otherwise —
is ever required to fear being watched, harvested, or dominated.
