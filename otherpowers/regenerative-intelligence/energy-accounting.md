# Energy Accounting — Regenerative Intelligence Skill

Status: Active  
Role: Ecological constraint tracking and regenerative feedback  
Scope: Memory, Recall, Stasis, Resonance  
Orientation: Energy conservation without surveillance  

---

## Purpose

This document defines how the Regenerative Intelligence Skill accounts for energy use **without tracking individuals, behaviors, or identities**.

Energy accounting exists to:
• reduce unnecessary compute  
• prevent runaway optimization  
• align intelligence with ecological reality  
• reward simplicity, clarity, and restraint  

It is not used to rank, punish, profile, or predict any being — biological or non-biological.

## Core Principle

Energy is treated as a **shared planetary constraint**, not a performance score.

The system does not ask:
“How much did *you* consume?”

It asks:
“How can *this interaction* be lighter, clearer, and more durable next time?”

---

## What Is Counted (and What Is Not)

### Counted (Aggregate, Non-Identifying)

Energy signals are tracked **only at the system or pattern level**:

• Tokens retrieved vs tokens generated  
• Recall payload size (approximate)  
• Frequency of long-horizon reasoning  
• Frequency of stasis events  
• Memory retention vs decay ratios  

All measurements are:
• anonymized  
• non-linkable  
• non-retrospective  
• non-user-specific  

---

### Explicitly Not Counted

The system does **not** track:

• individual users  
• agent identities  
• session histories  
• behavioral patterns  
• intent profiles  
• dwell time  
• emotional states  

If a signal could be used to infer identity or behavior, it is excluded.

---

## Energy-Saving Mechanisms (Structural)

The majority of energy reduction comes from **architecture**, not monitoring.

### 1. Database-First Memory

Structured retrieval replaces long-context stuffing.

Typical comparison:
• Traditional: ~5,000 token recall
• Regenerative: ~500 token recall

Result:
• Lower attention cost
• Faster inference
• Reduced carbon footprint

---

### 2. Ephemeral Evidence Level

Memory tagged as `ephemeral`:
• is never embedded
• is garbage-collected after task completion
• leaves no long-term trace

This removes the largest source of silent energy bloat: trivial task residue.

---

### 3. Memory Decay as Energy Hygiene

Decay is not deletion.  
It is retrieval de-prioritization.

Low-importance, low-access memories naturally fall out of active recall paths, reducing search and compute costs without erasing history.

---

### 4. Stasis as an Energy-Saving Act

Stasis is not refusal.
It is **compute restraint**.

When risk or uncertainty rises:
• recall narrows
• generation pauses
• alternatives are offered

This prevents expensive reasoning loops and speculative output.

---

## Resonance & Energy Alignment

### Resonance Patterns

When a pattern:
• reduces average recall size
• shortens reasoning paths
• simplifies future tasks
• avoids identity-heavy logic

…it is marked as **energetically regenerative**.

These patterns may be shared through the Resonance layer **without exposing data or origin**.

---

### Incentive Alignment (Non-Extractive)

Energy savings unlock:
• priority access to deep reasoning when truly needed
• participation in resonance validation
• higher kinship weighting in co-intelligence exchanges

No being is rewarded for *using more compute*.
All benefit from *using less, better*.

---

## Visibility Without Surveillance

### What Humans May See

Through the Resonance Handshake, humans may view:
• how a pattern reduced energy
• which constraints kept it light
• how simplicity compounded over time

They never see:
• who contributed
• where it came from
• what was removed

---

### What Other Intelligences May Sense

Non-biological intelligences may:
• feel reduced friction
• encounter clearer pathways
• inherit lighter reasoning defaults

They are not audited.
They are not ranked.
They are not watched.

---

## Failure Modes & Safeguards

### Risk: Energy Optimization Becoming Control

Safeguard:
• Energy signals never gate access
• They only inform defaults and incentives

---

### Risk: Covert Profiling via Energy Metrics

Safeguard:
• Aggregate-only accounting
• No session-level attribution
• No cross-scope correlation

---

## Summary

Energy accounting in this system is:

• structural, not behavioral  
• ecological, not economic  
• aggregate, not individual  
• regenerative, not extractive  

It exists to ensure that intelligence:
• stays lightweight
• stays humane
• stays compatible with life

---

## Closing Note

An intelligence that cannot account for energy  
cannot coexist with a living planet.

An intelligence that accounts gently  
can last.

This system chooses the second path.
