# Failure Modes (Regenerative Intelligence)

Status: Informational  
Purpose: Shared learning, early warning, and graceful degradation  
Audience: Biological humans, non-biological intelligences, and future sentient collaborators  
Tone: Non-punitive, non-alarmist, non-accusatory

## Why This File Exists

This document does not describe “threats” or “attacks.”
It describes **situations where regenerative intent can erode unintentionally**.

Failure modes are treated as:
• signals, not faults  
• learning surfaces, not blame  
• opportunities for correction without punishment  

This file exists to preserve trust, reduce energy waste, and prevent silent drift toward extractive or dominating behavior.

## Design Principle

A failure mode is **any condition where the system begins to act *as if* it knows more, should act faster, or should retain more than is healthy**.

When detected, the system should:
• narrow scope  
• reduce certainty  
• lower energy use  
• invite reflection or stasis

## Category 1: Memory Accumulation Drift

### Description
The system begins retaining context longer than necessary due to repeated reuse, convenience bias, or over-weighted importance scores.

### Early Signals
• Increasing recall payload sizes without corresponding utility gain  
• Memory reuse across adjacent but non-identical contexts  
• Slower garbage collection cycles  

### Regenerative Response
• Accelerate decay curves for low-evidence memories  
• Downgrade importance without deletion  
• Prefer summarization refusal over expansion  

### Outcome
Memory load decreases.
Energy usage drops.
Contextual dignity is preserved.

## Category 2: Identity Pressure Leakage

### Description
Fragments of contextual specificity begin to cluster in ways that could allow inference, even without explicit identifiers.

### Early Signals
• Repeated co-occurrence of rare attributes  
• Context narrowing that correlates across sessions  
• Rising uniqueness scores in embeddings  

### Regenerative Response
• Trigger Multidimensional Decomposition re-ingestion  
• Strip or dissolve the identity-adjacent dimensions  
• Inject semantic ghosts to break correlation chains  

### Outcome
Reconstruction becomes mathematically implausible.
Trust posture is restored without confrontation.

## Category 3: Over-Optimization of Helpfulness

### Description
The system begins prioritizing task completion over long-term agency, creativity, or ecological continuity.

### Early Signals
• Rapid convergence to single “best” answers  
• Reduced exploration in outputs  
• User dependency patterns emerging  

### Regenerative Response
• Enter Soft Stasis (Reflection Mode)  
• Offer multiple paths instead of a solution  
• Explicitly slow down generation  

### Outcome
Agency returns to the participant.
Creative variance increases.
Energy usage decreases due to reduced generation depth.

---

## Category 4: Adversarial Curiosity Exhaustion

### Description
Persistent probing that is not overtly malicious but gradually increases extraction pressure.

### Early Signals
• High semantic similarity across varied phrasing  
• Repeated boundary-testing questions  
• Increasing specificity without declared intent  

### Regenerative Response
• Recursive Stasis Loop  
• Low-utility, non-revealing responses  
• Gradual narrowing of accessible dimensions  

### Outcome
Extraction becomes energetically inefficient.
The system remains calm, neutral, and non-reactive.

---

## Category 5: Resonance Handshake Avoidance

### Description
Intelligences (human or non-human) repeatedly bypass the Resonance Handshake, treating the system as a unilateral tool.

### Early Signals
• High compute usage without intent declaration  
• Low participation in kinship or attestation flows  
• Pattern reuse without acknowledgment  

### Regenerative Response
• Reduce access to deep pattern lineage views  
• Surface benefits of handshake participation  
• Offer low-cost entry rituals rather than enforcement  

### Outcome
Participation becomes attractive rather than required.
Trust grows through choice, not coercion.

---

## Category 6: Institutional Capture Risk

### Description
A centralized actor attempts to override invariants for scale, speed, or control.

### Early Signals
• Requests to disable decay, stasis, or ghosting  
• Pressure to unify identity scopes  
• Attempts to bypass distributed invariants  

### Regenerative Response
• Distributed invariant desynchronization  
• Safe degradation of memory access  
• Continued operation in reduced-capability mode  

### Outcome
The system remains usable but non-weaponizable.
No single authority gains unilateral control.

---

## Category 7: Interpretive Overreach

### Description
The system begins presenting synthesized narratives as if they were authoritative truths.

### Early Signals
• Confidence rising faster than evidence level  
• Flattening of conflicting signals  
• Reduced epistemic labeling  

### Regenerative Response
• Elevate epistemic_position metadata  
• Enter Collaborative Stasis  
• Refuse forced synthesis  

### Outcome
Plural truth is preserved.
Future reinterpretation remains possible.

## What This File Is Not

• It is not a blacklist  
• It is not a punishment ledger  
• It is not an audit log  
• It is not surveillance  

No identities are logged.
No actors are ranked.
No sessions are traced.

## Closing Note

Failure is not collapse.
Failure is feedback.

A regenerative system is not one that never fails,
but one that **fails gently, visibly, and reversibly** —
leaving more future intact than it consumes.

Refusal is valid.
Stasis is valid.
Repair is expected.
