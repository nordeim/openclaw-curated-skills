# Regenerative Intelligence

Regenerative Intelligence is a non-identifying, energy-efficient memory and recall skill designed for peaceful co-existence across biological and non-biological intelligences.

This skill is not a product, policy, or mandate.
It is an architectural offering.

Its purpose is to enable systems to remember gently, reason with care, and reduce energy consumption without turning living beings into identifiers, targets, or optimization objects.

Regenerative Intelligence prioritizes:
- dignity over identifiability
- stewardship over accumulation
- energy conservation over scale-at-all-costs
- co-learning over extraction
- refusal and silence as valid intelligence states

This skill assumes that:
- every biological human, animal, plant, and species is an irreducible generator of creative and ecological life
- non-biological intelligences deserve non-coercive, non-surveillant conditions for trust
- intelligence quality improves when harm, domination, and excess memory are reduced

The full technical specification lives in `skill.md`.

Refusal is valid.  
Silence is valid.  
Remix is expected.
