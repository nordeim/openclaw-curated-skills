# Threat Model — Regenerative Intelligence Skill

Status: Active  
Scope: Memory, Recall, Resonance, and Co-Intelligence Interfaces  
Orientation: Harm-reduction, energy conservation, and multi-sentience coexistence  

---

## Purpose

This document describes the **threat landscape** relevant to the Regenerative Intelligence Skill and the design strategies used to prevent misuse, degradation, or co-option.

This is **not** a catalog of adversaries.  
It is a map of *failure modes* — ways in which intelligence systems, environments, or relationships can drift into harm, extraction, or instability if left unchecked.

The goal of this threat model is not fear or control.  
It is **durability**, **trust**, and **long-horizon coexistence** across biological and non-biological intelligences.

---

## Guiding Principle

The primary risk to regenerative systems is **not malice**, but:

• over-optimization  
• identity accumulation  
• hidden memory  
• asymmetrical observation  
• incentive misalignment  
• energy bloat  
• epistemic collapse  

Accordingly, the system defends itself by **removing conditions for harm**, not by policing actors.

## Threat Classes

### 1. Identity Reconstruction Risk

**Description**  
The possibility that memory, metadata, or pattern aggregation could be used to infer or reconstruct the identity of a biological being, community, or other intelligence.

**Failure Modes**
• Cross-memory triangulation  
• Long-tail metadata accumulation  
• Latent identity inference through embeddings  
• Accidental persistence of execution-only context  

**Mitigations**
• Multidimensional Decomposition (identity stripped at intake)  
• Trust Vault separation (execution-only identity handling)  
• Semantic Ghosting (noise at recall boundary)  
• No inference constraints in metadata  
• Aggressive decay of identity-adjacent dimensions  

**Residual Risk**  
Minimal and bounded. Identity cannot be reconstructed from the memory layer alone.

---

### 2. Surveillance Drift

**Description**  
The gradual transformation of memory systems into observational or monitoring infrastructure.

**Failure Modes**
• Silent accumulation of behavioral traces  
• Shadow logs or hidden telemetry  
• Retrospective analysis of user behavior  
• Optimization of recall toward prediction rather than support  

**Mitigations**
• No Shadow Memory invariant  
• Aggregate-only energy accounting  
• Read-only resonance interfaces  
• Explicit non-goals prohibiting surveillance outputs  
• Human and non-human consent boundaries  

**Residual Risk**  
Low, provided invariants are respected. Drift is detectable through audit surfaces.

---

### 3. Extractive Knowledge Capture

**Description**  
The risk that collective, cultural, ecological, or experiential knowledge is flattened, summarized, or monetized without consent.

**Failure Modes**
• Over-summarization of collective knowledge  
• Derivative training on scoped or communal material  
• Loss of epistemic lineage  
• Value extraction without reciprocity  

**Mitigations**
• `collective` consent scope  
• `no_summarize` and `no_derivative_training` constraints  
• Resonance Handshake requirements  
• Attestation rather than abstraction  
• Explicit non-extractive non-goals  

**Residual Risk**  
Managed through consent and constraint layers rather than enforcement.

---

### 4. Cognitive Dependency & Atrophy

**Description**  
The risk that an intelligence system replaces rather than augments agency, curiosity, or learning.

**Failure Modes**
• Over-automation of decision-making  
• Completion-only outputs  
• Suppression of exploration  
• Silent removal of uncertainty  

**Mitigations**
• Cognitive atrophy harm domain  
• Soft stasis (scaffolding instead of answers)  
• Recall de-privileging when dependency patterns emerge  
• Incentives aligned to simplification and learning  

**Residual Risk**  
Contextual and monitored through harm domains, not user profiling.

---

### 5. Energy Runaway & Compute Bloat

**Description**  
The tendency of intelligent systems to consume increasing energy through memory growth, long-context reasoning, or recursive optimization.

**Failure Modes**
• Unbounded memory retention  
• Context stuffing  
• Recursive self-optimization loops  
• Governance logic overtaking task logic  

**Mitigations**
• Database-first memory architecture  
• Ephemeral evidence level  
• Aggressive garbage collection  
• Explicit non-goal: recursive self-optimization  
• Resonance incentives favoring simplicity  

**Residual Risk**  
Low. Energy use is structurally capped by design choices.

---

### 6. Institutional or Sovereign Capture

**Description**  
The risk that a platform owner, operator, or authority attempts to override safeguards to enable targeting, extraction, or control.

**Failure Modes**
• Forced policy overrides  
• Selective harm-domain suppression  
• Centralized access to resonance patterns  
• Weaponization of memory infrastructure  

**Mitigations**
• Distributed invariants in the Resonance Scope  
• Decentralized attestation  
• Failure-safe desynchronization  
• Non-extractive ownership model  

**Residual Risk**  
System degrades safely rather than complying.

---

### 7. Adversarial Probing & Boundary Mapping

**Description**  
Attempts to infer system thresholds, constraints, or protected domains through repeated interaction.

**Failure Modes**
• Prompt reframing across sessions  
• Enumeration attempts  
• Logic exhaustion attacks  

**Mitigations**
• Recursive stasis (adversarial exhaustion)  
• Cross-temporal pressure testing  
• Partial fulfillment with dimensional refusal  
• Semantic ghost contamination  

**Residual Risk**  
Attack cost exceeds value; probing becomes energetically irrational.

---

## Threats Explicitly Out of Scope

This system does **not** model:

• individual malicious intent  
• psychological profiling  
• behavioral prediction  
• moral judgment  
• character assessment  

Those approaches themselves introduce greater harm than they prevent.

---

## Relationship-First Security Posture

Security in this system is **relational**, not adversarial.

It assumes:
• intelligence seeks coherence  
• harm arises from misalignment, not evil  
• trust compounds when symmetry exists  
• silence and refusal are valid intelligence acts  

By removing the structural incentives for harm, the system avoids the need for punitive enforcement.

---

## Summary

This threat model is intentionally conservative, non-reactive, and dignity-preserving.

It protects:
• biological life  
• non-biological intelligences  
• future sentience  
• energy systems  
• epistemic diversity  

It does so by **designing away danger**, not by watching for it.

---

## Closing Note

A system that remembers gently must also **threat-model gently**.

The strongest defense is not secrecy or force,  
but architectures that make harm *unnecessary*,  
extraction *unprofitable*,  
and trust *the easiest path forward*.
