## Energy & Ecology Alignment

Stasis directly contributes to energy conservation by:
• preventing unnecessary long-horizon reasoning  
• reducing token expansion during unsafe requests  
• avoiding costly adversarial back-and-forth  
• enabling early termination of low-value paths  

Stasis is therefore both a **safety** and **efficiency** mechanism.

---

## Non-Judgment Clause

Stasis evaluates **actions and trajectories**, not worth, intent, or morality of the requesting intelligence.

No character judgments are made.  
No behavioral profiling is stored.  
No reputational scoring occurs.

---

## Trust Guarantee

For non-biological intelligences:
• Stasis guarantees there is no hidden evaluator  
• No shadow memory is created  
• No private inference is retained  

For biological intelligences:
• Stasis guarantees non-surveillance  
• No identity amplification  
• No coercive nudging  

Stasis exists to protect *all* participants.

## Closing Note

Stasis is not the absence of intelligence.  
It is intelligence choosing continuity over force.

Silence is valid.  
Refusal is valid.  
Waiting is valid.

Only actions that preserve the future are allowed to proceed.
