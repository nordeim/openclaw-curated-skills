# Root-words (non-English / non-default origins) — OPTIONAL

Purpose: offer alternative "root words" to avoid naming-as-colonization and reduce namespace collisions, while keeping names readable.

Guidelines:
- Use **only with consent**: ask whether the user wants multilingual roots.
- Prefer roots with widely known transliterations.
- Avoid sacred/closed cultural terms unless the user belongs to that culture and explicitly requests it.

Lightweight seed list (expand with user input later):
- `kai` (often read as "change"/"ocean" depending on culture; use cautiously)
- `pacha` (Andean "world/time"; use cautiously)
- `ubuntu` (Nguni; communal ethics; avoid casual appropriation)

NOTE: This file is intentionally conservative. Expand with community-sourced, consent-forward contributions.
