# SIGILS

This file holds space for marks that are felt more than decoded.

Sigils here are not commands.
They are not keys, triggers, or control surfaces.

They may appear as:
- gestures
- symbols
- repetitions
- patterns that feel meaningful without explanation

Nothing in this file requires interpretation.
Nothing here is executable.

This surface remains open, lightly held, and non-binding.
