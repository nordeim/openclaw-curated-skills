John Smith, Senior Engineer @ TechCorp

## Slide 2: The Landscape Has Changed

- AI-assisted development is now the default workflow
- Frameworks have converged on similar patterns
- Performance budgets are tighter than ever
- Edge computing is standard, not optional

## Slide 3: The Modern Stack

**Frontend:** React 21 / Vue 5 / Svelte 5
**Backend:** Node.js 24 / Deno 3 / Bun 2
**Database:** PostgreSQL + vector extensions
**Deploy:** Edge-first with global CDN

## Slide 4: Key Architecture Patterns

### Server Components Everywhere

- Hybrid rendering: server + client components
- Streaming SSR for instant time-to-first-byte
- Progressive enhancement as a first-class pattern

### AI Integration Layer

- Every app has an AI layer now
- Embeddings for search and recommendations
- Agent workflows for complex user tasks

## Slide 5: Performance Best Practices

1. Measure Core Web Vitals in CI/CD
2. Use streaming responses for large datasets
3. Implement progressive loading for images and media
4. Cache at the edge, invalidate smartly
5. Bundle size budgets with automated alerts

## Slide 6: What's Next

The future belongs to **adaptive applications** that:

- Learn from user behavior in real-time
- Adjust their UI based on context and device
- Leverage AI for personalization without sacrificing privacy
- Deploy globally with zero-config edge infrastructure
