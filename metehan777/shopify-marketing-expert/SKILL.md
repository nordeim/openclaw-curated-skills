| Free Shipping | After add-to-cart | Contextually relevant |
| Spin-to-Win | 10-15 seconds | Time to engage |

### 2.3 A/B Testing Framework

**What to A/B Test (Priority Order)**:

| Element | Impact Potential | Test Ideas |
|---------|------------------|------------|
| Offer Type | Very High | % off vs $ off vs free shipping |
| Headline | High | Question vs statement, urgency |
| CTA Button | High | Color, text, size |
| Timing | Medium | 5s vs 10s vs 15s |
| Design | Medium | Modal vs slide-in vs bar |
| Form Fields | Medium | Email only vs email + name |
| Images | Medium | Product vs lifestyle vs none |

**A/B Testing Rules**:

```
1. Test ONE variable at a time
2. Run for minimum 7 days or 1,000 views
3. Aim for 95% statistical significance
4. Document all tests and results
5. Winner becomes new control
6. Continuously test (never stop)
```

**Common A/B Test Results**:

| Test | Typical Winner | Lift |
|------|---------------|------|
| 10% off vs 15% off | 15% off | +23% |
| % off vs $ off | Depends on price point | Varies |

**Types of Social Proof**:

| Type | Implementation | Impact |
|------|---------------|--------|
| Customer Reviews | Loox, Judge.me, Yotpo | +18-25% CVR |
| Photo Reviews | Visual UGC in reviews | +30% CVR on reviewed products |
| Purchase Notifications | "X bought recently" | +5-10% CVR |
| Customer Count | "Join 50,000+ customers" | Trust building |
| Trust Badges | Security, guarantee icons | +15% CVR |
| Press Mentions | "As seen in..." logos | Authority building |
| Influencer Content | UGC from influencers | Aspirational proof |

**Review Collection Strategy**:

```
Post-Purchase Email Sequence:

Email 1 (Day 7): "How are you enjoying [Product]?"
- Simple star rating request
- One-click review option

Email 2 (Day 14): "Share a photo, get 15% off next order"
- Photo review incentive
- Easy upload link

Email 3 (Day 21): "Final reminder" (to non-reviewers)
- Highlight impact: "Help other shoppers"
- Incentive reminder
```

### 2.5 Pricing Psychology

**Pricing Tactics That Work**:

| Tactic | Example | Psychology |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Charm Pricing | $29.99 vs $30 | Left-digit effect |
| Anchor Pricing | ~~$100~~ $75 | Creates reference point |
| Bundle Pricing | 3 for $50 (vs $20 each) | Perceived value |
| Decoy Pricing | S $15, M $25, L $26 | Makes L irresistible |
| Free + Shipping | Free product, $9.99 ship | "Free" is powerful |
| Tiered Pricing | Good, Better, Best | Middle option wins |

**Discount Psychology**:

```
Rule: % off vs $ off

Price < $100: Use % off (sounds bigger)
  "$30 item: Save 20%" beats "Save $6"

Price > $100: Use $ off (sounds bigger)
  "$500 item: Save $100" beats "Save 20%"

Always test both for your audience!
```

**Urgency & Scarcity Tactics**:

| Tactic | Implementation | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Limited Time | Countdown timer | Must be real |
| Limited Stock | "Only 5 left" | Must be accurate |
| Limited Offer | "First 100 customers" | Creates exclusivity |
| Seasonal | "Summer Sale ends Sunday" | Natural deadline |
| Flash Sale | 24-48 hour promotions | High urgency |
