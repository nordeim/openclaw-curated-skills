# OmniSearch Skill - Web Search Tool

## CRITICAL: When to Use This Skill

**ALWAYS use OmniSearch when:**
- User explicitly asks to "search", "google", "look up", "find online"
- User asks about current events, news, or recent developments
- User requests prices, product specs, reviews, or comparisons
- User asks "what's the latest..." or "what's happening with..."
- You need to verify current facts, statistics, or data
- User asks about people, companies, or organizations you don't know
- Information might have changed since your training cutoff
- User needs sources or citations for factual claims

**Examples of queries requiring OmniSearch:**
- "What's the weather in Hamburg today?"
- "Search for iPhone 16 reviews"
- "What happened in the tech industry this week?"
- "Find the current price of Bitcoin"
- "Look up restaurants near me"
- "What are people saying about the new Tesla model?"

## DO NOT Use OmniSearch When:
- Answering from your existing knowledge is sufficient and current
- User is asking for creative content, code, or analysis
- Question is about concepts, definitions, or timeless information

## How to Execute Search

**IMPORTANT**: Run the script from the omnisearch skill directory using the relative path `./scripts/omnisearch.sh`

### Method 1: Recommended (Wrapper Script)

Use the wrapper script for all searches:

```bash
# AI-enhanced search (includes summarization) - USE THIS FOR MOST QUERIES
./scripts/omnisearch.sh ai "your search query here"

# Raw web search results (when you need direct source material)
./scripts/omnisearch.sh web "your search query here"
```

**Available providers:**
- **ai** type: `perplexity` (default - recommended for most queries)
- **web** type: `perplexity` (default), `brave`, `kagi`, `tavily`, `exa`

**Optional provider override:**
```bash
./scripts/omnisearch.sh ai "query" perplexity
./scripts/omnisearch.sh web "query" brave
./scripts/omnisearch.sh web "query" kagi
./scripts/omnisearch.sh web "query" tavily
./scripts/omnisearch.sh web "query" exa
```

**Practical examples:**
```bash
# Current weather
./scripts/omnisearch.sh ai "weather in Hamburg today"

# Product research
./scripts/omnisearch.sh web "iPhone 16 Pro reviews 2024"

# News search
./scripts/omnisearch.sh ai "latest AI developments this week"

# Price comparison
./scripts/omnisearch.sh web "DJI Mini 4 Pro price Germany" brave

# Research with premium provider
./scripts/omnisearch.sh web "machine learning papers 2024" kagi
```

### Method 2: Fallback (Direct mcporter)

Only use if the wrapper script fails:

```bash
mcporter call omnisearch.ai_search query="your search query" provider="perplexity"
mcporter call omnisearch.web_search query="your search query" provider="brave"
```

## Response Format

After receiving search results, ALWAYS:

1. **Summarize**: Present 2-5 key bullet points with the most relevant findings
2. **Cite sources**: Include 2-6 source URLs formatted as clickable links
3. **Add context**: Note if information is time-sensitive or has low confidence
4. **Answer directly**: Don't just dump results - synthesize and answer the user's question

**Example response structure:**
```
Based on my search, here's what I found:

- [Key finding 1]
- [Key finding 2]
- [Key finding 3]

Sources:
- [Title 1](URL1)
- [Title 2](URL2)

Note: This information is from [date/timeframe] and may change.
```

## Search Query Best Practices

- Keep queries concise and specific (3-8 words ideal)
- Use natural language, not keyword stuffing
- Include location when relevant: "restaurants Hamburg"
- Include timeframe when needed: "iPhone 16 reviews 2024"
- For prices, include currency/region if specific: "iPhone 16 price Germany"

---

## Troubleshooting

**If the wrapper script fails:**
1. Check if you're in the correct directory (should contain `scripts/` folder)
2. Verify the script has execution permissions: `chmod +x ./scripts/omnisearch.sh`
3. Try the fallback method (direct mcporter call)
4. Check if mcporter is properly installed and configured

**Common issues:**
- **"command not found"**: Script path is incorrect or you're not in the skill directory
- **"No such file"**: The script may not have been copied to `scripts/` folder yet
- **Empty results**: Try different provider or rephrase query

**Query formatting:**
- Queries with spaces are automatically handled (no need to escape)
- Use quotes in the command: `./scripts/omnisearch.sh ai "query with spaces"`
- Special characters should work fine within the quoted string

## Important Notes

- **Directory structure**: This SKILL.md file is in the omnisearch skill folder, with the script in `./scripts/omnisearch.sh` relative to this file
- **Script validation**: The wrapper script automatically validates that a query is provided and will show usage help if missing
- **Provider selection**:
  - **Perplexity** (default): Best for AI-enhanced results with summarization and context
  - **Brave**: Good for privacy-focused, unfiltered web results
  - **Kagi**: Premium search with advanced filtering and ranking
  - **Tavily**: Optimized for research and comprehensive coverage
  - **Exa**: Semantic search with AI-powered relevance
- This is a LOCAL tool - it runs on this OpenClaw instance
- ALWAYS run the search immediately when user requests it - don't ask permission
- The wrapper script (omnisearch.sh) is designed to work reliably even with basic LLMs
