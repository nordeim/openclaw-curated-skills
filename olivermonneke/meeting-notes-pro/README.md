# Meeting Notes Pro

**Fight meeting fatigue with structure, accountability, and ruthless focus on outcomes.**

## What This Skill Does

Meeting Notes Pro turns your AI assistant into a meeting productivity expert. It provides structured templates and opinionated guidance to ensure every meeting is worth attending — or gets cancelled.

## Features

### 📝 Meeting Summary Generator
Paste raw notes or transcripts → get structured summaries with Key Decisions, Action Items (owner + deadline), Open Questions, and a Parking Lot. Every action item gets an owner and deadline, or gets flagged.

### 📋 Action Item Tracker
Track open items across multiple meetings. See overdue, due-soon, and upcoming items at a glance. Generate follow-up reminder emails with one prompt.

### 📅 Meeting Agenda Builder
Build professional agendas with timeboxing, topic types (Info/Discussion/Decision), facilitator notes, and pre-read materials. Includes anti-pattern detection — the skill will push back on bloated agendas.

### 👥 1:1 Meeting Templates
Ready-to-use templates for:
- **Manager ↔ Report weekly 1:1s** — with check-in, blockers, growth topics
- **Coaching conversations** — using the GROW framework
- **Quarterly performance check-ins** — with self-assessment and mutual feedback

### 📖 Decision Log
Document decisions with full context: options considered, rationale, trade-offs accepted, and revisit criteria. Never wonder "why did we decide that?" again.

### 📊 Meeting Effectiveness Score
Rate any meeting on 6 dimensions (Goal, People, Time, Preparation, Outcomes, Engagement) and get a score out of 10 with specific improvement recommendations.

## Example Prompts

- "Summarize these meeting notes: [paste notes]"
- "Create an agenda for a 30-min product review with 3 topics"
- "Show me all open action items from this week's meetings"
- "Set up a 1:1 template for my weekly with Sarah"
- "Log this decision: We chose Postgres over MongoDB because..."
- "Rate this meeting's effectiveness: [describe what happened]"
- "Could this meeting have been an email? [describe meeting]"

## Philosophy

- **No meeting without a purpose** — if you can't state the goal in one sentence, it's not ready
- **No meeting without outcomes** — every meeting produces decisions, action items, or both
- **Shorter is better** — 25 min, not 30. Give people buffer.
- **Written beats spoken** — if it can be async, it should be
