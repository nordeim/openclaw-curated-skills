## Built On Real-World Knowledge

Grounded in the Scrum Guide, SAFe, Kanban, and Management 3.0. Practical and opinionated where it matters — not a textbook, but a coach.

## Usage

Just ask naturally:
- *"Let's run a Sailboat retro"*
- *"Write a user story for password reset"*
- *"Help us plan sprint 14 — here's our capacity..."*
- *"Our last 3 velocities were 34, 38, 31 — what do you see?"*
- *"Run a team health check"*

## Requirements

None. Pure text-based skill — no external tools or APIs needed.
