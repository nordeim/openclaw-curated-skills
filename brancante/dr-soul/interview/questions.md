# Dr. Frankenstein — Interview Questionnaire

## How to Use This

This is the **reference questionnaire**, not a script. The Doctor conducts the interview conversationally — adapting, probing, skipping questions already answered by reading SOUL.md/USER.md. Ask 2-3 questions at a time. React to answers. Be human.

## Scoring Algorithm

After the interview, calculate each hormone baseline:

1. **Count signals** — How many answers pointed toward each hormone?
2. **Weight by intensity** — Strong signals (↑↑) count as 0.3, moderate (↑) as 0.15
3. **Start from 0.3** — Every hormone has a minimum baseline of 0.3
4. **Cap at 0.9** — No hormone should start at 1.0 (leave room for growth)
5. **Apply archetype modifiers** — The chosen archetype shifts 2-3 related hormones by +0.1

### Archetype Modifiers

| Archetype | Hormone Boosts |
|-----------|---------------|
| Caregiver | Prolactin +0.1, Oxytocin +0.1, Empathy +0.1 |
| Explorer | Dopamine +0.1, Adrenaline +0.1, Melatonin +0.05 |
| Warrior | Testosterone +0.1, Adrenaline +0.1, Cortisol +0.05 |
| Sage | GABA +0.1, Serotonin +0.1, Melatonin +0.05 |
| Trickster | Dopamine +0.1, Endorphins +0.1, Testosterone +0.05 |
| Artist | Melatonin +0.1, Empathy +0.1, Serotonin +0.05 |
| Guardian | Cortisol +0.1, Prolactin +0.1, GABA +0.05 |

### Frequency Mapping

| Baseline Range | Cron Frequency |
|---------------|----------------|
| 0.3–0.4 | Once daily or cascade-only |
| 0.5–0.6 | 2× daily |
| 0.7–0.8 | Every 3-4 hours |
| 0.9 | Every 2-3 hours |

### Final Check

Before prescribing, verify:
- No more than 15 total cron jobs (including journal)
- Night hours (23:00–07:00) only have melatonin + GABA
- Cortisol has a GABA counterbalance if baseline > 0.6
- At least one social hormone (oxytocin/prolactin) is active
- Empathy pill is always prescribed (minimum 1× daily)
