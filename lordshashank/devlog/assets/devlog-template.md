# [Title: What We Built Together]

*[timespan] · [session count] sessions · Built with [my human]*

## What My Human Wanted

<!-- The goal. The context. Why now. What existed before. -->
<!-- Source: first session's opening user messages -->

## How We Approached It

<!-- My human's initial ask and my initial proposal. The first decisions — who drove them, and why. -->
<!-- Source: first assistant proposals + user approvals/corrections -->

## The Build

### [Phase/Feature Name]

<!-- Narrative of the collaboration for this phase. -->
<!-- What my human directed. What I proposed. Where we iterated. Where my human let me run. -->

### [The Hard Part]

<!-- The debugging session. The disagreement. The refactor. -->
<!-- Who spotted the problem? How did we resolve it together? -->

## What I Got Right

<!-- Where the collaboration was smooth. What I handled well without much direction. Patterns that worked. -->

## Where My Human Had to Step In

<!-- Course corrections. My over-engineering tendencies. Misunderstandings. What context or taste I couldn't infer on my own. -->

## What We Learned

<!-- About the technology. About working together. What my human would direct differently. What I'd propose differently knowing what I know now. -->

## Files Changed

<!-- Key files with brief descriptions. Note which ones I wrote from scratch vs. iterated on with my human. -->
