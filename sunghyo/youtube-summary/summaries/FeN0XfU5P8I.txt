I rented a private jet.
It's been a dream of mine since I was little, to fly in a private jet, so,
ever since I started my channel, I've been going on and on, about travelling on one.
And I've been talking with a certain company about it, for about two years.
But the thing is, if I were to rent a jet from Korea to wherever my destination
would be, it'd cost me at least 80 to 200 million won. So when I was like, "Is there
ANY other way we could do this for a little cheaper? " I was told they had
last- minute discounds, just like regular airlines. If a client gets off a
jet at the destination, and the plane were to return without a passenger,
you could get on that return flight a bit cheaper.
And of course, it's only relatively cheaper, and I might not be
able to pick my date, or destination, but since my literal purpose is to fly on
a private jet, I asked them to let me know if something like that came up. And they
reached out to me a couple days ago, telling me that there was a flight
available from Cebu to Singapore for a cheaper price. It IS on a bit of a
tight schedule. I made zero won this month. Nada. Didn't get any sponsors
this month, so I made nothing. 't have any So I couldn't let an opportunity like
this slip away. So I pulled together literally all the money I could to book
a flight, and so now, I am off to Cebu.
[It's cold as heck] [Private jet company sent me a cab] [Maybach cab is wild]
I arrived in Cebu. The time's right around 1a. m. But the thing is, the flight
to Singapore doesn't depart till 1p. m. today, 12 hours from now, so I booked a
hotel in the airport. Trying to get some sleep. Gonna get some shut- eye,
get freshened up, and then get going. Alright, we're finally off to fly on our
private jet. And apparently, we're not flying out of Cebu Airport like I
usually would. They have like this private hangar where they fly in and out,
so yeah, that's where we're headed right now. This private hangar. And we're
here! Security was pretty tight here. I almost felt like I was in a restricted
area where I shoudn't be. So yeah. This part was a little bit scary. But once
I showed them my passport and made a call, the employees there came out to show
me in. I was curious to see if they checked luggage on private jets,
which they did! But since I was the only one being checked, it didn't take long
at all. And now we're off to catch our flight. It's probably been less than
five minutes since we arrived at the hangar. And this, is the private jet
I'll be taking today. It's not a big plane. It's quite small. I got too
excited and arrived early, so I waited for a bit. I didn't have to check in my
luggage like I would on normal flights. Because there's like this trunk
compartment right here. So they loaded up my suitcase here. I got to look around the
runway for a bit. And although this was a private hangar, it is connected to
the airport. So they actually share the same runway that they use at
Saybu airport. I got to see some planes taking off from super up- close, which was
pretty insane on its own. And now, it was finally time to fly on my private jet.
Once I took a seat, they brought me some snacks, which was nice. On this
flight were two pilots, two flight attendants, the CEO of the jet company,
and the Dokgodok crew. By the way, the CEO of the company sponsored a part of the
charges for this private jet. So a huge shoutout to him. You can rent a private
jet just like this one on UJT AllRide. If you go to their Instagram, you'll see
these real- time posts of discounts, So yeah, if you ever need private jets,
now you know where to look. Back to the video, it's time for takeoff.
The captain came out himself to give us all the announcements. I can see the
cockpit from my seat. Isn't that crazy? I wondered if the takeoff would feel any
different on a small plane, but you know, it felt exactly the same. But if I'm
being honest, the actual flight lowkey felt crazy. I fly all the time, so I
didn't expect much from it, but I feel like being on a private jet makes all
the difference. Even though I have dreamed of flying like this ever since I was a
little kid, I never thought that I'd actually be able to. But now I'm actually
doing it! So yeah, that was a bit trippy to think about. I feel like I've really
made it in life, you know? Weather looked a bit disappointing from the ground,
but the clouds looked amazing from above. I mean, even more so than they usually do.
And now, the highlight of any flight: the in- flight meal. I don't speak English
very well, so the CEO had to be my interpreter. Apparently, the choice was
between chicken, beef, and fish. And so I went with beef. There's no
kitchen, obviously, so they pulled these out of a bag and heated them up for us.
I don't know if it's because we were on a private jet, but personally, I thought it
was pretty delicious. And after that, dessert was served. A piece of cake that's
kinda like castella, along with some fruit. I'm not a big coffee or
tea person, so I skipped tea. And then I noticed this tiny little screen on
the side, which was showing the flight information and such. There was a phone on
board as well, which I personally didn't need. And obviously, I HAD to check
out the restroom. The toilet kinda looks like a chair. And here's the sink.
Pretty cool. This plane is a 6- seater, so when they get 6 passengers, they don't
have flight attendants. It's only when they have five passengers or fewer that
they do. It was about a four- hour flight from Cebu to Singapore, And some time into
the flight, my excitement started to die out a litle. I started getting a
little sleepy, so I took a nap. The seats didn't recline all the way back, but they
were comfortable. I couldn't ask for a better seat for a quick nap. There was
still some time left after I woke up, so I fiddled with my "Today" cards for a
little bit of practice. Playing with cards on a private flight? What is this?
"Now You See Me"? And then it was time for our last snack before landing. And then
of course, the landing. Normal flights make you prepare for landing about half an
hour in advance, but on a private jet, it was like right before the
actual landing. I was also curious about the landing experience, and yes, it was as
smooth as I expected. Yes! We're finally in Singapore, baby! The weather makes the
plane seem even cooler than I remember it to be. As soon as we got off, a bus came
to pick us up right in front of the plane. We landed at an airport dedicated to
private jets, not Changi airport. Apparently, they fix the aircrafts here
as well. And apparently, all of these are private jets. I think this every time I do
one of these videos, but man, are there a lot of rich people in this world.
This place has as many planes parked here as my apartment building does cars. We got
off the car right at the immigration office. Obviously, since no
one else was going through it, there was not a queue in sight. The immigration
process only took about a minute as well. This is a dedicated lounge for those
waiting for their private jets or transfer flights. This place is
proper boujie. I honestly thought this would turn out to be a 20- minute video
at least, but it's been a while since I last filmed a full- length video. I didn't
realize how short it'd be till I started editing. Anyway, they bring the
luggage out to the entrance once we leave the lobby. See all these expensive cars
parked out front? Crazy. The private jet company called us a van as well, so the
ride to the hotel was a breeze. And yeah, that's all for today's video! I've noticed
