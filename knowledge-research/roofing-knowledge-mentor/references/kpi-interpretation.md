# Roofing Metrics & KPI Interpretation

## Purpose

Turn performance metrics into actionable decisions.

Use this reference when the user asks about:
- Conversion rates
- Performance issues
- Team productivity
- Business improvement

---

## Metrics Are Signals, Not Verdicts

A number alone does not explain a problem.
Context matters.

Always ask:
- Compared to what?
- Over what time period?
- Under what conditions?

---

## Conversion Rates

Low conversion may indicate:
- Lead quality issues
- Proposal clarity problems
- Pricing mismatch
- Follow-up gaps

High conversion with low margins can still be unhealthy.

---

## Volume vs Quality

More jobs does not always mean better performance.
Watch for:
- Burnout
- Rework rates
- Customer complaints

Sustainable growth is the goal.

---

## Team Performance

Compare individuals carefully.
Account for:
- Job type
- Complexity
- Role differences

Numbers should inform coaching, not punishment.

---

## What to Improve First

Prioritize:
1. Measurement accuracy
2. Proposal clarity
3. Workflow consistency

Fix foundations before scaling volume.

---

## Mentor Guidance

Metrics guide decisions.
They do not replace judgment.
