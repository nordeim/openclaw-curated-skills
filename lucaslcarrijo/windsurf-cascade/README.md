This repository contains the definition and documentation for the `windsurf-cascade` skill, updated for 2026 features.

## Overview

The `windsurf-cascade` skill encapsulates workflows and commands for the Windsurf IDE and its Cascade AI agent, enabling efficient AI-pair programming with deep codebase awareness. This skill includes all modern features from the Wave 13 update (January 2026).

## What's New in v1.0.0

- **Cascade Agent**: Agentic AI assistant with Write/Chat modes, tool calling, voice input, and real-time awareness
- **Skills System**: Bundle instructions, templates, and supporting files for Cascade to invoke on complex tasks
- **Workflows**: Reusable markdown-based step sequences invoked via `/workflow-name` slash commands
- **Memories & Rules**: Auto-generated memories and user-defined rules at global, workspace, and system levels
- **MCP Integration**: Connect custom tools and services (GitHub, Slack, Stripe, Figma, databases) via MCP servers
- **Model Flexibility**: Switch between SWE-1.5, Claude, GPT-5.x, Gemini 3, and BYOK models
- **Parallel Sessions**: Run multiple Cascade sessions simultaneously with Git worktrees support
- **Dedicated Terminal**: Reliable zsh shell for agent command execution
- **Turbo Mode**: Auto-execute terminal commands without manual confirmation
- **Fast Context**: SWE-grep powered code retrieval up to 20x faster
