# Outlook to Gmail Migration

## Migration Paths

Assess the source environment first:

| Source | Best Method | Scope |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Office 365 / Exchange Online | Google Data Migration Service (Admin Console) | Org-wide, bulk |
| On-prem Exchange | GWMMO tool or IMAP migration | Per-user or bulk |
| PST files | GWMMO tool or Outlook IMAP bridge | Per-user |
| Outlook.com (personal) | IMAP migration in Admin Console | Per-user |

## Pre-Migration Checklist

Run through this with the client before touching anything:

1. **Inventory** — Number of users, total mailbox sizes, largest mailbox, shared mailboxes, distribution lists
2. **Google Workspace plan** — Confirm active subscription, verify admin access (Super Admin required)
3. **Source admin access** — Global Admin (O365) or Exchange Admin + app passwords
4. **DNS access** — Whoever manages MX records (registrar, Cloudflare, etc.)
5. **Data scope** — Email only? +Contacts? +Calendars? +Drive files?
6. **Cutover window** — When to switch MX records (weekend recommended)
7. **Client communication** — Draft email to users about the switch, new login instructions
8. **Retention** — Keep source mailboxes active 30 days post-migration as safety net

## Method 1: Google Data Migration Service (Recommended for O365)

Best for org-wide migrations from Exchange Online / Office 365.

### Setup

1. Google Admin Console → **Data** → **Data import & export** → **Data Migration (New)**
2. Select **Microsoft Office 365** as source
3. Click **Connect** → sign in as Microsoft Global Admin → grant permissions
4. Select what to migrate: Email, Contacts, Calendars
5. Choose date range filter (optional — migrate only last N months to save time)

### Execution

1. Add users to migrate (CSV upload for bulk: `source_email,destination_email`)
2. Start migration — Google handles delta sync automatically
3. Monitor progress in Admin Console → shows per-user status
4. Migration runs in background — users can keep using Outlook during this phase

### CSV Format

```csv
source_email,destination_email
john@company.onmicrosoft.com,john@company.com
jane@company.onmicrosoft.com,jane@company.com
```

See `references/csv-template.md` for full template with notes.

## Method 2: GWMMO Tool (PST / Outlook Profile)

Best for individual users or PST file imports.

1. Download GWMMO: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gsmmo/
2. Install on machine with Outlook profile or PST access
3. Sign in with Google Workspace account
4. Select Outlook profile or browse to PST file
5. Choose data: Email, Contacts, Calendars, Junk
6. Start import — progress shown in tool

**Limitations**: Runs per-user, requires desktop access, Windows only.

## Method 3: IMAP Bridge (Manual / Small Scale)

For personal Outlook.com accounts or when other methods fail:

1. Enable IMAP in Gmail: Settings → Forwarding and POP/IMAP → Enable IMAP
2. In Outlook desktop, add Gmail as IMAP account
3. Drag-and-drop folders from Outlook mailbox to Gmail IMAP folders
4. Slow but works for any IMAP-capable source

## DNS / MX Cutover

After migration data is transferred:

1. **Verify domain** in Google Admin Console (TXT record)
2. **Update MX records** to Google:
   ```
   Priority  Host
   1         ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM
   5         ALT1.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM
   5         ALT2.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM
   10        ALT3.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM
   10        ALT4.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM
   ```
3. **Set SPF**: `v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all`
4. **Set DKIM**: Admin Console → Apps → Gmail → Authenticate email → Generate DKIM
5. **Set DMARC**: `v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:admin@domain.com` (start with `p=none`, tighten later)
6. **TTL**: Lower TTL to 300 before cutover, restore to 3600 after 48h

See `references/dns-records.md` for copy-paste DNS templates.

## Post-Migration Validation

Run these checks for every user:

- [ ] Email receiving on Gmail (send test from external)
- [ ] Historical emails present (spot-check oldest + newest)
- [ ] Folders/labels mapped correctly
- [ ] Contacts imported (check count)
- [ ] Calendar events present (check recurring events specifically)
- [ ] Shared mailboxes / groups recreated as Google Groups
- [ ] Signatures set up in Gmail
- [ ] Mobile devices re-configured (Gmail app or IMAP)
- [ ] Outlook desktop disconnected or reconfigured

See `references/validation-checklist.md` for printable per-user checklist.

## Common Issues

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Migration stuck at 0% | Re-authorize source admin credentials |
| Missing folders | Google flattens deep nesting → becomes labels |
| Calendar recurring events broken | Re-create manually (known Google limitation with complex recurrences) |
| Contacts duplicated | Use Google Contacts merge duplicates tool |
| Large attachments missing | Items >25MB not migrated — export separately |
| Shared mailbox not migrating | Convert to Google Group or shared drive |
| MX propagation slow | Check TTL, use `dig MX domain.com` to verify |

## Deliverables Template

For client-facing migration projects, prepare:

1. **Migration Plan** — Timeline, phases, user batches, rollback plan
2. **User Communication** — Email template announcing the switch
3. **Admin Runbook** — Step-by-step for the migration operator
4. **Validation Report** — Per-user sign-off checklist

See `references/client-templates.md` for ready-to-use templates.
