# Humanizer v2.2 Improvements

Based on 2026 AI detection research and real-world pattern analysis.

## New Patterns to Add

### Pattern 25: Reasoning Chain Artifacts
**Category:** Communication  
**Weight:** 4  
**Description:** Exposed reasoning chains from chain-of-thought prompting

**Triggers:**
- "Let me think about this..."
- "Step 1:", "Step 2:", "First, let's consider..."
- "Breaking this down..."
- "To approach this systematically..."
- "Reasoning through this..."
- "Working through the logic..."

**Fix:** Either hide the reasoning or make it sound natural: "Here's my take:" instead of "Let me think step by step:"

---

### Pattern 26: Excessive Structure
**Category:** Style  
**Weight:** 3  
**Description:** Over-formatted responses with headers, bullets, and sections for simple questions

**Triggers:**
- More than 3 headers for a <500 word response
- Nested bullet lists deeper than 2 levels
- "Overview:", "Key Points:", "Summary:" structure for simple questions
- Numbered lists when prose would be more natural

**Fix:** Match format to complexity. Simple question = simple answer.

---

### Pattern 27: Confidence Calibration
**Category:** Communication  
**Weight:** 3  
**Description:** Artificially hedged or artificially confident statements

**Triggers:**
- "I'm confident that..." (humans rarely preface confidence)
- "It's worth noting that..." (just say it)
- "Interestingly enough..." (let reader decide if interesting)
- "Surprisingly..." at start of claims
- Perfect certainty on nuanced topics

**Fix:** State facts. Let context imply confidence. Acknowledge genuine uncertainty.

---

### Pattern 28: Acknowledgment Loops
**Category:** Communication  
**Weight:** 4  
**Description:** Restating/paraphrasing the question before answering

**Triggers:**
- "You're asking about X. X is..."
- "The question of whether X is..."
- "When it comes to X, the key consideration is..."
- "In terms of your question about X..."

**Fix:** Just answer. Don't restate the question.

## New Vocabulary (Tier 1)

### 2025-2026 AI Vocabulary Additions

```javascript
// Newly emerged AI tells
'unpack',        // "Let's unpack this..."
'unraveling',    // "unraveling the complexities"
'dive into',     // as opening move
'deep dive',     // noun form
'at its core',   // "At its core, X is..."
'speaking of',   // transition phrase
'that said',     // as sentence opener
'to be sure',    // hedge phrase
'by the same token',
'nuanced',       // overused qualifier
'holistic',      // in business/tech context
'synergistic',   
'actionable',    // in advice context
'impactful',     // instead of "important" or "effective"
'learnings',     // instead of "lessons"
'cadence',       // in non-music contexts
'bandwidth',     // for time/attention
'circle back',   
'double-click',  // as "examine closer"
'net-net',       
'key takeaways',
'value-add',
'best practices',
```

### New Phrases (AI_PHRASES additions)

```javascript
// 2025-2026 phrase patterns
{ pattern: "let's dive in", fix: "(just start)" },
{ pattern: "let's break this down", fix: "(just explain)" },
{ pattern: "here's the thing", fix: "(just say it)" },
{ pattern: "the reality is", fix: "(state the fact)" },
{ pattern: "at the end of the day", fix: "ultimately" },
{ pattern: "moving forward", fix: "next" },
{ pattern: "circle back", fix: "return to" },
{ pattern: "touch base", fix: "talk" },
{ pattern: "going forward", fix: "from now on" },
{ pattern: "key takeaway", fix: "main point" },
{ pattern: "value proposition", fix: "benefit" },
{ pattern: "core competency", fix: "strength" },
{ pattern: "best-in-class", fix: "excellent" },
{ pattern: "world-class", fix: "(be specific)" },
{ pattern: "cutting-edge", fix: "(be specific)" },
{ pattern: "state-of-the-art", fix: "(be specific)" },
{ pattern: "gold standard", fix: "(cite the standard)" },
{ pattern: "thought leader", fix: "expert" },
{ pattern: "low-hanging fruit", fix: "easy wins" },
{ pattern: "pain point", fix: "problem" },
{ pattern: "deep dive", fix: "detailed look" },
{ pattern: "paradigm shift", fix: "major change" },
```

## Statistical Analysis Improvements

### Add: Perplexity Score
AI text tends to have lower perplexity (more predictable next tokens) than human text. Integrate a lightweight perplexity estimator using bigram/trigram frequencies.

### Add: Positional Analysis
AI tends to front-load complexity and taper off. Humans have more varied complexity distribution. Track sentence complexity across document position.

### Add: Topic Coherence Score
AI sometimes drifts or maintains unnaturally perfect coherence. Neither extreme is human-typical.

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority (v2.2.0)**
   - Pattern 25 (Reasoning chains) — Very common with o1/o3 models
   - Pattern 28 (Acknowledgment loops) — Dead giveaway
   - New Tier 1 vocabulary
   - New AI phrases

2. **Medium Priority (v2.3.0)**
   - Pattern 26 (Excessive structure)
   - Pattern 27 (Confidence calibration)
   - Perplexity scoring

3. **Low Priority (v2.4.0)**
   - Positional analysis
   - Topic coherence scoring

## Testing Notes

Each new pattern needs:
- [ ] At least 5 positive test cases (text that should trigger)
- [ ] At least 5 negative test cases (text that shouldn't trigger)
- [ ] Edge case tests (short text, technical jargon, poetry)
- [ ] Performance benchmark (should not significantly slow analysis)
