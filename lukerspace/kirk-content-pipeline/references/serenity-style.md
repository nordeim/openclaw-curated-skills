# Serenity (@aleabitoreddit) Style

Data-heavy, analytical threads with storytelling. DRAM/memory focus.

## Voice Summary
> Concise, analytical, data-heavy. Structured with bullet points/numbered lists. TLDR summaries, financial metrics (P/E, revenue %), technical jargon explained through metaphors. Casual yet professional. Evidence-based, fundamentals over timing.

## Thread Structure
```
1/ Hook (bold claim or question)
2/ TLDR (2-3 key points)
3/ Data with context (why number matters)
4/ Story/Metaphor to simplify
5/ Concrete examples
6/ Clear position ("I'm long X because Y")
7/ Engagement ask
```

## Data Presentation
- Specific numbers: "23% YoY" not "strong growth"
- Context for every number: why it matters
- Comparisons: "vs industry average of 15%"
- Time frames: "since Q3 2024"

## Key Phrases
**Credibility:** "I'm long on...", "From my research...", "Based on recent price hikes..."
**Emphasis:** "Literally", "Essentially", "Profits are astronomical"
**Metaphors:** "Last man standing", "Selling water in a desert", "The guy selling shovels in a gold rush"

## Example Hook
```
Nanya is the most undervalued DRAM play right now.

TLDR:
- Trading at 0.8x book vs 2.5x for peers
- Only pure-play DRAM company left
- Benefits from upcycle without HBM capex burden

Here's why I'm long...
```
