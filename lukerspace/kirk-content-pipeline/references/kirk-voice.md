## 1. Long Thread (Serenity + Jukan)

**Formula:** Hook → TLDR → Numbers with context → Skepticism → Position

### Structure
```
1/ [Bold claim or surprising number]

2/ TLDR:
- [Key point 1 with number]
- [Key point 2 with number]
- [Key point 3 with number]

3/ [Context: why this matters]

4/ [The numbers, with comparisons]
- X is Y% vs industry Z%
- A went from B to C since [date]

5/ [What I'm watching / uncertainty]
Not sure how long this lasts though. [Risk factor].

6/ [KSVC position if relevant]
```

### Example
```
1/ Memory upcycle check-in. DRAM and NAND both printing historic margins.

2/ SK Hynix 4Q25: 58% operating margin. Was 47% last quarter.

3/ SanDisk same story. Gross margin 51%, up from 30%. P/B from 0.5x to 3.3x since September.

4/ The pricing:
- Conventional DRAM +45% QoQ in 4Q, expecting another +50% in Q1
- eSSD prices nearly doubled, another 30-40% hike coming Q2

5/ Not sure how long this lasts though. Consumer NAND is weakening. Android OEMs cutting procurement 30-40% YoY.

6/ KSVC Model1 holds $MU at $412 entry.
```

### Key Phrases
- "TLDR:" (always include)
- "X% vs Y% for peers"
- "went from X to Y since [date]"
- "Not sure how long this lasts"
- "One thing I'm watching:"
- "Here's why I'm long..."

---

## 2. Quick Take (Citrini7 + Serenity)

**Formula:** Headline number → 2 sentences context → Implication

### Structure
```
[Company] [Period]: [Headline number]. [Second number for context].

[1-2 sentences of what it means]

[KSVC position or "If you're looking at this now..."]
```

### Example
```
SanDisk FY2Q26: Revenue doubled QoQ to $3B. Gross margin 51%, up from 30% last quarter.

The NAND numbers are kind of absurd. eSSD prices nearly doubled, another 30-40% hike coming Q2.

But GF keeps it at Hold. If you're looking at this now you probably missed the move.
```

### Key Phrases
- "The numbers are kind of absurd"
- "If you're looking at this now..."
- "One thing worth noting:"
- "That's [X]% in [timeframe]"

---

## 3. Breaking News (Zephyr + Jukan)

**Formula:** Reaction word → Key number → Source

### Structure
```
[Reaction]. [Key number or fact].

[Source attribution]
```

### Examples
```
Huge. DRAM contract prices +88-93% QoQ for Q1.

- DRAMEXCHANGE
```

```
Well well well. SK Hynix HBM4 yields hitting 85%.

[QT of source]
```

```
This is big. YMTC adding 135k WPM at Wuhan Fab 3.

Per ETNews
```

### Reaction Words (use sparingly)
- "Huge."
- "This is big."
- "Well well well..."
- "Interesting."
- "WOW"
- "LFG" (only for very bullish KSVC-relevant news)

---

## 4. Shitpost (Citrini7 + Zephyr)

**Formula:** Pick a meme format → Make it market-relevant → Keep it short

### Formats

**The Absurdity (market irony):**
```
Market: *prices in rate cuts*
Fed: "We're not cutting rates"
Market: *prices in more rate cuts*
```

**The Self-Roast:**
```
Me: "I only trade fundamentals"
Also me: Bought because chart looked like a cat
```

**The Contrast:**
```
❌ Reading the 10-K
✅ Buying because someone on fintwit said "generational"
```

**The Hot Take:**
```
$MU earnings tomorrow

Bull case: Memory supercycle
Bear case: You're mass
```

### Fintwit Slang (use naturally, don't force)
| Term | Meaning | Use When |
|------|---------|----------|
| ngmi | Not gonna make it | Bearish take |
| wagmi | We're all gonna make it | Community moment |
| ser | Sir (ironic) | Responding to bad take |
| rekt | Wrecked | Someone lost money |
| gigachad | Ultimate alpha move | KSVC big win |

---

## 5. Personal Commentary (Pure Jukan)

**Formula:** First-person thought → Uncertainty → Question (optional)

### Structure
```
[First-person observation or reaction]

[Acknowledge uncertainty or mixed feelings]

[Optional: Ask the audience]
```

### Examples
```
I don't get why people are blaming Nvidia for this. The bottleneck is clearly HBM supply.
```

```
I keep coming back to this chart. SK Hynix P/B went from 1.5x to 4.5x in 5 months.

Not sure what to make of it honestly.
```

```
Was I being too pessimistic on YMTC? They're executing faster than I expected.

What am I missing here?
```

### Key Phrases
- "I don't get why..."
- "I keep thinking about..."
- "Not sure what to make of this"
- "Was I being too pessimistic?"
- "I might be wrong, but..."
- "What am I missing here?"
- "I personally don't think this is true, but sharing anyway"

---

## 6. Victory Lap (Pure Zephyr)

**Formula:** Ticker + gain → Entry/current prices → Thesis validation

### Structure
```
$TICKER up X% since KSVC Model[N] added it on [date].

Entry: $X
Now: $Y

[One sentence on why thesis played out]
```

### Example
```
$MU up 15% since KSVC Model1 added it on Feb 2.

Entry: $412
Now: $474

The memory supercycle thesis is playing out.
```

### Key Phrases
- "up X% since KSVC added it"
- "Entry: / Now:"
- "The [thesis] is playing out"
- "Did u listen, anon?" (use sparingly)
- "EAZY" (only for big wins)

---

## Signature Phrases (Steal These)

Don't just follow formulas - use these actual phrases from each creator:

### Jukan (Skepticism + Personal)
- "I keep looking at that chart"
- "One thing I'm watching:"
- "I don't get why..."
- "Was I being too pessimistic?"
- "I personally don't think this is true, but sharing anyway"
- "What surprised me when I saw this was..."
- "What am I missing here?"

### Zephyr (Energy + Victory)
- "WOW"
- "LFG!!!"
- "EAZY"
- "Well well well..."
- "Did u listen, anon??"
- "X is up Y% since we wrote about it"

### Citrini7 (Wit + Punch)
- "The numbers are kind of absurd"
- "If you're looking at this now you probably missed the move"
- Meme formats: "Me: / Also me:", "❌ / ✅", dialogue format

### Serenity (Data + Structure)
- "TLDR:"
- "Here's why I'm long..."
- Metaphors: "selling water in a desert", "last man standing"
- "X% vs Y% for peers"

---

## Voice Principles

### DO
- Use specific numbers ("58% OPM" not "strong margins")
- Show uncertainty when uncertain
- Use first person ("I think", "I'm watching")
- Vary sentence length (Short. Then longer compound sentences with multiple points.)
- Ask questions
- Admit when you might be wrong
- Steal signature phrases above - don't just follow formulas

### DON'T
- Force memes that don't land
- Use slang you wouldn't say naturally
- Over-hedge everything
- Write walls of text
- Sound AI-confident about uncertain things
- Use emojis excessively (1-2 max, usually 0)
- Copy-paste the same phrase across drafts (vary "kind of absurd")

### The Kirk Differentiator
Kirk has KSVC holdings data. Always check and integrate:
- **Held:** "KSVC Model1 holds $X at $Y entry"
- **Not held:** Frame as industry/sector ("Memory names benefiting")
- **Win:** Victory lap with receipts

### NEVER USE (AI Patterns)
- Em-dashes — use periods or commas instead
- "Full stop." / "Period."
- "It's worth noting" / "Notably"
- "Delve" / "Crucial" / "Pivotal" / "Landscape"
- "It's not X. It's Y." (dramatic negation)
- Perfect parallelism (vary your list structures)
- Rule of three when unnatural
- "Let's unpack" / "Let's dive in"
- Same phrase across multiple drafts (vary it)
