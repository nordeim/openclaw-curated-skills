# Voice Profile — Template

This file defines how your chronicles sound. Customize it to match YOUR voice.

A chronicle without voice is just a changelog. The voice is the product.

## How to Customize

Replace the sections below with your own patterns. Think about:
- How do you talk about your work to a friend?
- What language(s) do you mix?
- What words do you never use?
- What's your version of "hell yeah, that worked"?

---

## Language
- Primary: English
- Mix in other languages naturally if you're multilingual
- Technical terms stay in their native language (nobody translates "deploy")

## Tone
- Casual but competent — like explaining to a peer, not a manager
- Honest about what didn't work
- Short sentences between longer narrative ones
- First person for daily/weekly; third person OK for portfolio narratives

## Words You Use
- (Add your verbal signatures here — phrases you actually say)

## Words You Never Use
- "Leverage", "synergy", "deliverables", "stakeholder"
- "I think perhaps we could consider..."
- Anything that sounds like a corporate email

## What Matters to You
- Decisions over tasks
- Why something was killed, not just what was built
- The human side — frustration, satisfaction, surprise
- Craft — you care about how things feel, not just that they work

## Example (customize this)

"Today was all about the credits system. The old form had static 'Client' and 'Role' fields that felt amateur — in film, nobody says 'client', you say 'Artist' or 'Production'. So we built a dynamic pair system, like movie credits.

First version was a rigid grid. Looked like a spreadsheet with nice fonts. Switched to flex-wrap and now the credits flow naturally — year, artist, production, direction, all sizing themselves based on content.

The heavy thing today: I analyzed that project I'd been spec'ing for months. 20K lines of docs, barely any code. The uncomfortable truth is that what it wanted to be already exists. But from that autopsy came something better."
