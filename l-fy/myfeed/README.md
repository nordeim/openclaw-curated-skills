My Life Feed is a social productivity and scheduling app. It is designed to help friends and family coordinate plans, track goals, and send reminders in a more casual, engaging way than traditional calendar apps.

The OpenClaw skill can add things into My Life Feed app.
Your friends also receive reminders from their My Life Feed things.

The app's main goal is to replace the "chaos" of group chats with a streamlined way to propose plans and track who is doing what. 
Instead of burying plans in a text thread, you "send a thing" (an invitation or task) to specific friends or groups.
Key Features
"Send a Thing": This is the app's version of a calendar invite. You describe what you want to do (e.g., "Dinner at 8," "Study session") and select who to invite using their phone numbers.
Social Nudging: You can "nudge" friends with picture reminders to get their attention or remind them of upcoming plans, adding a visual and personal touch to notifications.
Simple Status Tracking:
Green Tick: Accepted.
Red X: Refused.
Empty Tick: Mark a task or event as "finished" so friends can see you've completed it.
Real-Time Goal Tracking: The app allows you to watch friends "crush their goals" in real-time, adding a layer of social accountability.
Personal Mode: You can use it for personal reminders by simply inviting no one.
Groups: Create specific groups (e.g., "Family," "Study Group") to send invites to multiple people at once easily.

Unique Aspects

Who Is It For?
It is best suited for close friend groups, couples, or families who want a dedicated space to organize their shared life—dates, chores, hangouts, or goals—without the formality of Google Calendar or the messiness of WhatsApp/iMessage threads.
