# Form Builder Skill

## Overview

This skill enables creation of intelligent document forms using **docassemble** - a platform for guided interviews that generate documents. Create questionnaires that adapt based on answers.

## How to Use

1. Describe the form or document you need
2. Specify conditional logic requirements
3. I'll create docassemble interview YAML

**Example prompts:**
- "Create an intake form for new clients"
- "Build a conditional questionnaire for legal documents"
- "Generate a multi-step form for contract generation"
- "Design an interactive document assembly form"
