## Best Practices

### Do's
- Use clear, straightforward language
- Include all material terms
- Specify deadlines clearly
- Provide contact for questions
- Include signature block

### Don'ts
- Don't make promises outside standard terms
- Don't include discriminatory language
- Don't forget contingencies
- Don't omit important details
- Don't use overly complex legal jargon

### Legal Considerations
- Offer letters are generally not contracts (add disclaimer if needed)
- At-will employment should be stated clearly (US)
- Equity terms should reference full agreement
- Have legal/HR review before sending

## Limitations

- This is a template guide, not legal advice
- Employment laws vary by jurisdiction
- Company-specific policies must be incorporated
- Complex equity arrangements need legal review
- International offers have additional requirements
