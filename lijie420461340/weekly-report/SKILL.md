## Writing Guidelines

### Accomplishments
- Start with action verbs (Completed, Delivered, Launched, Resolved)
- Be specific about outcomes, not just activities
- Quantify impact when possible
- Link to business value

**Good:** "Reduced API response time by 40%, improving user experience for 50K daily users"
**Bad:** "Worked on performance improvements"

### Blockers
- Be specific about the issue
- Explain the impact (delays, dependencies)
- State what help you need
- Include any attempted solutions

**Good:** "Waiting on API credentials from IT (ticket #1234). This blocks the integration work scheduled for this week. Need escalation to IT manager."
**Bad:** "Can't make progress on integration"

### Next Week Plans
- Be realistic about capacity
- Prioritize top 3-5 items
- Include dependencies
- Note any risks or assumptions

## Output Format

I'll generate a report matching your needs:

```markdown
# [Report Title]

**Period:** [Date range]
**Author:** [Name]
**Audience:** [Manager/Team/Executives/Client]

[Structured content based on template]
```

## Customization Options

Tell me your preferences:
- **Length:** Brief (bullet points), standard, detailed
- **Audience:** Team, manager, executives, clients
- **Focus:** Accomplishments, blockers, metrics
- **Frequency:** Can adapt for daily/bi-weekly/monthly
- **Tone:** Casual team update or formal stakeholder report

## Limitations

- Cannot access your actual work systems or calendars
- Relies on information you provide
- May need adjustment for your organization's specific format
- Should be reviewed for accuracy before sending

## Examples

### Example: Quick Status Update

**Input:** "I finished the dashboard redesign, fixed 3 bugs, still working on the user auth feature which is delayed because I'm waiting on the security review. Next week I'll focus on finishing auth and starting the mobile optimization."

**Output:**

# Weekly Status Report

**Name:** [Your Name]
**Week of:** [Current Week]

## 🎯 Summary

## 🚧 In Progress
| Task | Status | Expected Completion |
