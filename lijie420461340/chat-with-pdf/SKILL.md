2. Ask your question or request
3. Get contextual answers with citations

### Question Types

**Factual Questions**

```

**Summarization**

## Best Practices

### For Better Answers
1. **Be specific**: "What is the termination clause?" vs "Tell me about the contract"
2. **Reference sections**: "What does Section 5.2 say about liability?"
3. **Ask follow-ups**: Build on previous answers for deeper understanding

### For Better Extraction
1. **Specify format**: "Extract as a table" or "List as bullet points"
2. **Name the fields**: "Extract: name, date, amount, description"
3. **Set criteria**: "Only extract amounts over $10,000"

### For Better Summaries
1. **Specify length**: "Summarize in 100 words" or "3 bullet points"
2. **Focus area**: "Summarize the financial terms only"
3. **Audience**: "Summarize for a legal team" vs "for executives"

## Handling Challenges

### Scanned PDFs (Image-based)
- OCR will be applied automatically
- Quality depends on scan quality
- May have recognition errors

### Complex Layouts
- Tables may need reformatting
- Multi-column text is processed left-to-right
- Footnotes processed separately

### Long Documents
- Ask about specific sections for accuracy
- Request page-by-page summaries for overview
- Use targeted questions over broad ones

## Limitations

- Cannot execute code embedded in PDFs
- Password-protected PDFs need password
- Very large PDFs (500+ pages) may need chunking
- Handwritten content recognition is limited
- Cannot guarantee 100% accuracy on scanned documents
- Charts and images are described, not analyzed numerically

## Privacy Note

Document contents are processed according to the AI provider's privacy policy. For sensitive documents, consider:
- Using on-premise solutions
- Redacting sensitive information first
- Checking data retention policies
