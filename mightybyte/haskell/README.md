# Haskell Skill

The comprehensive [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io) for professional Haskell development. Built by senior Haskell developers and community leaders with years of production Haskell experience, this skill encodes the patterns, practices, and hard-won knowledge that define modern, industrial-strength Haskell.

## Overview

This skill gives any compatible coding agent deep expertise in Haskell programming, from project setup through production deployment. It reflects the way experienced Haskell engineers actually write code: type-driven, pragmatic, and grounded in real-world tradeoffs.

**Core philosophy:**

1. **Types are the design** -- Make illegal states unrepresentable
2. **Purity by default** -- Side effects are explicit in the type system
3. **Composition over inheritance** -- Small, composable functions and typeclasses
4. **Laziness as a tool** -- Elegant abstractions with awareness of space leaks
5. **Correctness first, then performance** -- Get it right, profile, then optimize
6. **Keep it simple** -- Haskell2010 + purity + strong types deliver the majority of the value

## What's Included

The skill follows a progressive disclosure architecture. The main `SKILL.md` provides immediately actionable guidance (~420 lines), while seven deep-dive reference documents cover advanced topics agents can load on demand.

### SKILL.md (Primary Instructions)

- Project setup and structure (Cabal 3.0)
- Essential GHC extensions (categorized: always-on, use-freely, avoid-unless-needed)
- Type-driven development patterns (newtypes, phantom types, smart constructors)
- Error handling (Either vs exceptions, the ReaderT pattern)
- Testing with HSpec and QuickCheck
- Performance essentials (strictness, profiling, space leak prevention)
- Common gotchas that trip up even intermediate Haskellers
- Key library recommendations across 18 packages
- Commands reference for the full build/test/profile lifecycle

## Installation

### Claude Code

Add the skill as a dependency in your project's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "skills": ["github:mightybyte/haskell-skill"]
}
```

Or install it directly:

```
/skill add github:mightybyte/haskell-skill
```

### OpenClaw

Install from [ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai/):

```bash
npx clawhub@latest install haskell
```

Or via the OpenClaw CLI:

```bash
clawhub install haskell
```

### Cursor

Add to your Cursor rules or `.cursor/skills/` directory. See [Cursor's Agent Skills documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/agent-skills) for details.

### Other Compatible Agents

This skill follows the open [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification). Any agent that supports the spec can use it. Clone or download the repository and point your agent's skill configuration to the `SKILL.md` file.

## Compatibility

- **GHC**: 9.2+ (some features reference GHC 9.2+ syntax like `OverloadedRecordDot`)
- **Build system**: Cabal 3.0+ (primary), with Nix and Stack guidance included
- **Language standard**: Haskell2010 as the base, with curated extensions

## Design Principles

This skill is intentionally opinionated. Rather than presenting every possible approach, it captures what works in production:

- **Pragmatic over academic** -- Recommends the simplest abstraction that solves the problem. Discourages reaching for advanced type machinery unless it pays for itself.
- **Battle-tested patterns** -- Every recommendation has been validated in real-world codebases. The ReaderT pattern, strict-by-default data types, Text-not-String -- these aren't theoretical preferences.
- **Progressive complexity** -- Agents start with the core instructions and pull in reference material only when the task demands it. Simple tasks stay simple.
- **Guardrails included** -- Explicit "avoid" lists for extensions, functions, and patterns that cause problems in practice. Twelve common gotchas that prevent the mistakes teams actually make.
