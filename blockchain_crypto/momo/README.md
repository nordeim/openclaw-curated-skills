# Momo

**Track time, bill clients.**

## For Freelancers

Momo simplifies the admin side of freelance work: no more spreadsheets, no missed hours, no invoice delays. Focus on your work; Momo handles the paperwork.

## Quick Start

1. Install Momo via ClawHub.
2. Add your first project: `timesheet.sh --log` (will prompt for project setup).
3. Log time daily; run `--report` weekly to stay on top of hours.

## Invoicing

Convert logged time to invoices with one command. Momo supports multiple formats (PDF, Markdown) and tracks invoice status (draft, sent, paid).
