# Crucial Conversations Theory Reference

## 1. Start with Heart (Work on Yourself First)
- **Identify your Goal**: Ask "What do I really want for myself? For others? For the relationship?"
- **Avoid Sucker's Choice**: Don't think you have to choose between two bad options (e.g., "I can be honest OR I can be kind"). Ask: "How can I [be honest] AND [be kind]?"

## 2. Learn to Look (Spotting Safety Issues)
- **Silence**: Masking (sarcasm, sugarcoating), Avoiding (staying away from the topic), Withdrawing (leaving the conversation).
- **Violence**: Controlling (forcing views), Labeling (putting a name on people/ideas), Attacking (belittling, threatening).

## 3. Make it Safe (Step Out, Restore, Step Back In)
- **Mutual Purpose**: Do they believe you care about their goals?
- **Mutual Respect**: Do they believe you respect them?
- **Contrasting**: "I don't mean to [X], I do want to [Y]." (Fixes misunderstandings about purpose).
- **CRIB (to find Mutual Purpose)**:
    - **C**ommit to seek mutual purpose.
    - **R**ecognize the purpose behind the strategy.
    - **I**nvent a mutual purpose.
    - **B**rainstorm new strategies.

## 4. Master My Stories (Path to Action)
- **Facts -> Stories -> Feelings -> Actions**.
- **Victim Stories**: "It's not my fault."
- **Villain Stories**: "It's all your fault."
- **Helpless Stories**: "There's nothing else I can do."
- **Turn them into Useful Stories**: "What am I pretending not to notice about my role?", "Why would a reasonable, rational, and decent person do this?", "What should I do right now to move toward what I really want?"

## 5. STATE My Path (Sharing Tough Messages)
- **S**hare your facts (least controversial, most persuasive).
- **T**ell your story (your conclusion based on facts).
- **A**sk for others' paths (invite them to share facts/stories).
- **T**alk tentatively (use "I'm beginning to wonder if..." vs "The fact is...").
- **E**ncourage testing (invite opposing views: "Does anyone see it differently?").

## 6. Explore Others' Paths (Active Listening)
- **AMPP**:
    - **A**sk (invite them to share).
    - **M**irror (reflect the emotions you see: "You seem upset...").
    - **P**araphrase (restate what you heard in your own words).
    - **P**rime (if they remain silent, offer a guess at what they're feeling/thinking).

## 7. Move to Action (Decide How to Decide)
- **Command**: Decision made without involvement.
- **Consult**: Input gathered, then decision made.
- **Vote**: Majority wins.
- **Consensus**: Everyone agrees.
- **Assignment**: Who does What by When. Follow up.
- **Clarity of Request**: In written communication, ensure the "Assignment" or "Next Step" is unmistakable and easy to act upon.
