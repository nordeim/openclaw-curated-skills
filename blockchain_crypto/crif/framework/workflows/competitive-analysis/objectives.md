# COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS

> **CRIF - CRYPTO RESEARCH INTERACTIVE FRAMEWORK - WORKFLOW OBJECTIVES**
> **NAME:** Competitive Analysis (competitive-analysis)
> **PURPOSE:** Define WHAT this workflow must achieve (mission, objectives, validation, deliverables)

## MISSION

Establish comprehensive head-to-head comparison of user-selected projects through systematic profiling, benchmarking, and positioning analysis. Delivers detailed project profiles with SWOT and moats assessment, rigorous comparison tables across metrics and capabilities, positioning maps identifying differentiation opportunities, and purpose-specific recommendations with evidence-based rationale. Enables confident investment or positioning decisions through fair, balanced, multi-source validated comparative analysis.

## OBJECTIVES

1. **Profile Each Project Comprehensively** - Conduct SWOT analysis, competitive moats assessment across 6 dimensions, 8-criteria crypto-native evaluation, and bear case analysis for each project with equal depth and no favoritism

2. **Create Head-to-Head Benchmarking Tables** - Build comparison tables for metrics benchmarking, feature matrix, technical architecture, and team backing with consistent structure enabling easy comparison and leader identification

3. **Conduct Comparative Positioning Analysis** - Build positioning map showing projects on strategic dimensions, identify positioning clusters and white spaces, create differentiation matrix analyzing unique advantages and weaknesses, and assess positioning effectiveness

4. **Deliver Purpose-Specific Recommendations** - Provide recommendations tailored to comparison purpose: investment ranking with scores, positioning strategy, or comparative insights, with risk assessment and alternatives for all cases
