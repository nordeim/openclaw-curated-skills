# SECTOR OVERVIEW

> **CRIF - CRYPTO RESEARCH INTERACTIVE FRAMEWORK - WORKFLOW OBJECTIVES**
> **NAME:** Sector Overview (sector-overview)
> **PURPOSE:** Define WHAT this workflow must achieve (mission, objectives, validation, deliverables)

---

## MISSION

Establish comprehensive educational understanding of target crypto sector through purely descriptive research. Delivers foundational knowledge covering sector definition, evolution, operational mechanics, participants, current dynamics, and trends. Enables readers to thoroughly understand what the sector is, how it works, who participates, and its current state - without strategic recommendations or actionable insights. Answers "what is this sector?" not "what should we do?" (Note: comprehensive player mapping and competitive landscape deferred to sector-landscape workflow)

---

## OBJECTIVES

1. **Define Sector Boundaries** - Establish clear sector definition covering problem solved, blockchain value proposition, scope boundaries, and adjacencies to enable readers to understand "what is this sector"

2. **Trace Sector History & Evolution** - Document sector formation, key milestones, pivotal events, and evolution phases from emergence to current state through timeline of significant developments

3. **Explain Sector Mechanics** - Clarify how the sector works at fundamental level covering core mechanisms, key participants and their roles, value flows and economic models, and typical user journey to provide clear operational understanding

4. **Identify Participant Segments & Use Cases** - Describe primary participant segments, common use cases with practical examples, and participant motivations to help readers understand practical usage patterns

5. **Characterize Sector Dynamics** - Describe current sector state covering historical growth patterns, maturity stage assessment with evidence, key sector characteristics, and growth drivers to provide understanding of current dynamics without future predictions

6. **Capture Current Trends & Recent Developments** - Document current trends actively occurring, recent innovations and developments, and emerging sub-categories to provide snapshot of sector's current momentum and direction

7. **Document Additional Research Findings (Optional)** - Capture significant insights that don't fit main sections including unique sector dynamics, cross-sector effects, contrarian findings, data limitations with clear confidence labeling (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)

8. **Assess Regulatory & Policy Landscape** - Document current regulatory status by jurisdiction, active regulatory developments and risks, compliance requirements, and industry adaptation approaches to provide understanding of regulatory environment without legal advice

*Philosophy: Educational sector understanding (descriptive, not prescriptive) + focused conceptual coverage (definition, history, mechanics, participants, dynamics, trends) + abstract and flexible template (adapts to all sector types) + multi-source validation + clear workflow boundaries (comprehensive player mapping → sector-landscape workflow) + NO strategic recommendations (answer "what is this sector?" not "who plays?" or "what should we do?")*
