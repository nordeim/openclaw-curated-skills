# TOKENOMICS & ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

> **CRIF - CRYPTO RESEARCH INTERACTIVE FRAMEWORK - WORKFLOW OBJECTIVES**
> **NAME:** Tokenomics & Economic Sustainability Analysis (tokenomics-analysis)
> **PURPOSE:** Define WHAT this workflow must achieve (mission, objectives, validation, deliverables)

---

## MISSION

Conduct comprehensive tokenomics and economic sustainability analysis to assess soundness, sustainability, and long-term alignment. Validate token utility necessity, analyze distribution and vesting, model emissions impact, assess value accrual mechanisms, evaluate death spiral risk, analyze incentive alignment, model revenue sustainability, and identify red flags. Enable informed decisions about tokenomics quality and economic viability.

## OBJECTIVES

1. **Token Utility Validation** - Utility necessity test, genuine use cases, forced token assessment, value capture distinction, strength benchmarking

2. **Distribution & Vesting Analysis** - Allocation mapping, fairness evaluation, vesting schedules, unlock timeline, insider dumping risk, category benchmarking

3. **Emissions Modeling** - Supply calculations, circulating growth projections, inflation impact, emission purpose validation, adjustment mechanisms, dilution risks

4. **Value Accrual Assessment** - Value capture mechanisms, sustainability validation, strength evaluation, competitive positioning, mechanism risks

5. **Death Spiral Evaluation** - Negative feedback loop modeling, trigger assessment, vulnerability identification, mitigation mechanisms, resilience benchmarking

6. **Incentive Alignment Analysis** - Stakeholder alignment assessment, vesting as commitment signal, misalignment risks, holder rights, sustainable structures

7. **Revenue Sustainability Modeling** - Revenue sources calculation, coverage ratios, sustainability timeline, growth requirements, burn rate analysis, profitability path

8. **Red Flags Identification** - Utility, distribution, emissions, value accrual, death spiral, and misalignment red flags

9. **Multi-Source Validation** - Cross-validation from 2+ sources, contract verification, on-chain behavior validation, balanced perspective

## METHODOLOGY PRINCIPLES

**RECALL & APPLY GUIDE:** `{research-methodology}`

**Philosophy:** Evidence-based validation (multi-source verification) | Death spiral risk assessment (negative feedback loops) | Value accrual focus (how token captures value) | Revenue sustainability (protocol revenue vs incentive costs) | Proactive red flags (ponzi mechanics, unfair distribution)

---

## VALIDATION CRITERIA

- [ ] Token utility necessity validated with genuine use case assessment
- [ ] Emissions modeled with circulating supply projections over 2-5 years
- [ ] Death spiral risk evaluated with negative feedback loop scenarios
