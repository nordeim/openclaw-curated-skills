## MISSION

Transform crypto research into platform-optimized content that amplifies distribution reach and drives audience engagement. Deliver content tailored to audience knowledge level, maintaining research accuracy while achieving format-specific engagement objectives. Adapt narrative and format to platform requirements while preserving core message integrity.

## OBJECTIVES

1. **Define Narrative Strategy** - Identify core message from research, determine narrative angle, understand target audience, extract key takeaways, and design narrative flow that delivers value progressively

2. **Create Platform-Optimized Content** - Transform research into selected format(s) following platform-specific best practices for structure, pacing, and engagement patterns. Adapt narrative, length, and tone to maximize platform effectiveness while preserving research integrity.

3. **Maintain Research Integrity** - Ground all claims in source research, preserve nuance when condensing, distinguish facts from analysis, include appropriate attribution

4. **Optimize for Engagement** - Craft format-appropriate hooks, structure for retention and completion, include strategic calls-to-action, suggest media elements where applicable
