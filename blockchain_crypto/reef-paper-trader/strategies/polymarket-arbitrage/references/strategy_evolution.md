## Evolution History

### Iteration #0 - Initial Setup

**Strategy**: Starting parameters based on prediction market theory

**Hypotheses to Test**:
1. Same-market mispricings are rare but profitable
2. Correlation arbs exist due to market segmentation
3. Time decay arbs require precise timing
4. Cross-platform arbs have execution risk

**Key Questions**:
- What's the average edge available?
- How often do arbs appear?
- What's the average resolution time?
- What's typical slippage?
