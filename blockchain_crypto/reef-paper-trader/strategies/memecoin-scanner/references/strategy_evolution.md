## Evolution History

**Strategy**: Starting parameters based on general memecoin trading wisdom

**Hypothesis**:

- Strict stop losses will limit downside
- Scaling out preserves gains

**To Validate**:
- Is 70 score threshold too high/low?
- Are factor weights appropriate?
- Is -30% stop too tight or too loose?
