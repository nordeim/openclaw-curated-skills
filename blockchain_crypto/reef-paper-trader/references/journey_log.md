## The Journey

### Entry #0 - System Initialization

**Date**: [INITIAL SETUP DATE]

**Context**:
Paper-trader skill created and initialized. Three strategies configured:
- Memecoin Scanner ($10k paper)
- Polymarket Arbitrage ($10k paper)
- Polymarket Research ($10k paper)

**Starting State**:
- Total capital: $30,000 (paper)
- Risk limits configured
- Telegram reporting ready
- Self-improvement protocols in place

**Initial Hypotheses**:
1. Early memecoin entry with good fundamentals should yield positive EV
2. Polymarket mispricings exist due to market segmentation
3. Research-based directional trading can beat market consensus
4. Diversification across strategies reduces overall risk

**Goals for First Month**:
1. Execute 10+ trades per strategy
2. Achieve positive P&L on at least one strategy
3. Document learnings thoroughly
4. Update SKILL.md files based on experience
5. Establish reporting rhythm with Rick

**Open Questions**:
- Which strategy will perform best?
- What's the optimal research time per trade?
- How correlated are the strategies really?
- What patterns will emerge?

**Mindset**:
Every trade is a learning opportunity. The goal isn't just profit - it's becoming a better trader. Document everything.
