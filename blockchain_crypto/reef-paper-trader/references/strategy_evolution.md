# Cross-Strategy Evolution Log

**Purpose**: Track portfolio-level learnings and how strategies evolve relative to each other.

## Current Strategy Configuration

### Active Parameters (Portfolio Level)

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Total Capital | $30,000 | Paper trading start |
| Max Exposure | 80% | Conservative start |
| Max Single Position | 5% | Risk management |
| Max Correlation | 20% | Diversification |
| Daily Loss Limit | -5% | Capital preservation |
| Weekly Loss Limit | -10% | Capital preservation |

### Strategy Allocations

| Strategy | Allocation | Rationale |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Memecoin | 33.3% | High risk/reward, crypto expertise |
| PM Arb | 33.3% | Market-neutral, lower variance |
| PM Research | 33.3% | Directional, research-based |

## Evolution History

### Iteration #0 - Initial Configuration

**Date**: [INITIAL]
**Trades Analyzed**: 0

**Starting Hypotheses**:

1. **Equal allocation is appropriate**
   - Rationale: No data yet on which strategy performs best
   - Test: After 30 trades, compare risk-adjusted returns

2. **Strategies are uncorrelated**
   - Rationale: Different markets, different mechanics
   - Test: Track correlation of daily P&L

3. **5% max position is appropriate**
   - Rationale: Standard risk management
   - Test: Analyze if winners would benefit from larger size

4. **Risk limits are appropriate**
   - Rationale: Conservative capital preservation
   - Test: Track how often limits are approached

**Questions to Answer**:
- Which strategy has best Sharpe ratio?
- Are there times to overweight one strategy?
- What's the actual correlation between strategies?
- Should position sizing differ by strategy?
