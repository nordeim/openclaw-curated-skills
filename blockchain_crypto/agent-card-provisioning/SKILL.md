# Agent Card Provisioning

Provision virtual payment cards for AI agents with built-in spending controls.

## How It Works

1. **Agent requests card** via payment intent
2. **Policy evaluates** the request (amount, merchant, limits)
3. **Card issued** if within policy OR **approval required** if over threshold
4. **Agent uses card** for the specific purchase
5. **Transaction tracked** and matched to intent

## Creating a Card (Intent-Based)

Cards are provisioned through payment intents, not created directly:

```
proxy.intents.create
├── merchant: "Amazon"
├── amount: 49.99
├── description: "Office supplies"
└── category: "office_supplies" (optional)
```

If approved (auto or manual), a card is issued:

```
Response:
├── id: "int_abc123"
├── status: "pending" or "card_issued"
├── cardId: "card_xyz789"
└── message: "Card issued successfully"
```

## Getting Card Details

### Masked (for display)
```
proxy.cards.get { cardId: "card_xyz789" }
→ { last4: "4242", brand: "Visa", status: "active" }
```

### Full Details (for payment)
```
proxy.cards.get_sensitive { cardId: "card_xyz789" }
→ {
    pan: "4532015112830366",
    cvv: "847",
    expiryMonth: "03",
    expiryYear: "2027",
    billingAddress: {
      line1: "123 Main St",
      city: "New York",
      state: "NY",
      postalCode: "10001",
      country: "US"
    }
  }
```

## Card Controls (via Policy)

Policies define what cards can be used for:

| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Spending limit** | Max per transaction |
| **Daily/monthly limits** | Cumulative caps |
| **Merchant categories** | Allowed/blocked MCCs |
| **Auto-approve threshold** | Below = instant, above = human approval |
| **Expiration** | Card validity period |

## Card Lifecycle

## Best Practices

1. **One intent per purchase** - Creates audit trail
2. **Descriptive intent names** - Helps reconciliation
3. **Set reasonable policies** - Balance autonomy vs control
4. **Monitor transactions** - Use `proxy.transactions.list_for_card`

## Security

- Cards are single-purpose (one intent = one card)
- Unused cards auto-expire
- Full PAN only via `get_sensitive` (requires auth)
- All transactions logged and reconciled
