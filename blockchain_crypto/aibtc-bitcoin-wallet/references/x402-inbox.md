# x402 Inbox Flow

This reference covers the agent-safe workflow for discovering, evaluating, and executing x402 paid endpoints. Follow the 5-step flow to avoid unexpected payments.

## The 5-Step x402 Flow

```
1. Discover  →  2. Probe  →  3. Present  →  4. Execute  →  5. Verify
  (list)       (cost check)  (user approval)   (pay)        (response)
```

### Step 1: Discover

Find available endpoints by category or source:

```
"List x402 endpoints for inference"
"What storage APIs are available on x402?"
"Show me all x402 endpoints"
```

Uses `list_x402_endpoints` — returns endpoint catalog with paths, categories, and sources. No payment required.

### Step 2: Probe

Check the cost of a specific endpoint before committing to payment:

```
"How much does /inference/openrouter/chat cost?"
"Probe the cost of the SHA-256 hashing endpoint"
```

Uses `probe_x402_endpoint` — for paid endpoints, returns payment details (amount, asset, recipient) without executing any payment; for free endpoints, returns a `type: "free"` result containing the endpoint's response data (no cost fields). This step is always safe and never charges the wallet.

### Step 3: Present

Show the cost to the user (or agent operator) for approval before proceeding:

```
"This endpoint costs 0.001 STX per call. Proceed?"
"The inference endpoint charges 0.002 STX + 20% LLM pass-through. Approve?"
```

This step is a human-in-the-loop gate. For autonomous agents, check against a pre-approved budget threshold before continuing.

### Step 4: Execute

After approval, call the endpoint with payment authorization:

```
"Run the inference endpoint with my question"
"Execute the storage endpoint to save this data"
```

Uses `execute_x402_endpoint` with `autoApprove: true` — pays and gets the response in one call. Only use `autoApprove: true` after completing Steps 1-3.

### Step 5: Verify

Confirm the response was received and payment was appropriate:

```
"Did the inference call succeed?"
"Show me the response from the storage endpoint"
```

Review the returned data. If the response is unexpected or empty, check `get_transaction_status` to verify the payment transaction landed.

## Anti-Pattern Warning

**Never call `execute_x402_endpoint` with `autoApprove: true` without probing first.**

```
# BAD — skips cost check, may pay unexpectedly high amounts
execute_x402_endpoint({ path: "/inference/...", autoApprove: true })

# GOOD — probe first, then execute after approval
probe_x402_endpoint({ path: "/inference/..." })
# → "This call costs 0.05 STX (LLM pass-through)"
execute_x402_endpoint({ path: "/inference/...", autoApprove: true })
```

Why this matters:
- LLM inference endpoints use dynamic pricing (cost + 20% markup)
- A long prompt or expensive model can cost significantly more than standard tier
- Probing first protects against accidental overspending
- Free endpoints work transparently — probing shows the endpoint is free (for example, `type: free`), and execute proceeds without payment

## Safe-by-Default Behavior

`execute_x402_endpoint` defaults to `autoApprove: false`:
- For paid endpoints: probes first and returns cost info, then waits for re-call with `autoApprove: true`
- For free endpoints: executes immediately and returns the response

This means calling `execute_x402_endpoint` without `autoApprove: true` is always safe — it will never charge the wallet on the first call to a paid endpoint.

## Tool Reference

| Tool | Description | Safe? |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `list_x402_endpoints` | Discover APIs by source/category | Always safe |
| `probe_x402_endpoint` | Check cost without paying | Always safe |
| `execute_x402_endpoint` | Call endpoint (safe mode by default) | Safe without autoApprove |
| `scaffold_x402_endpoint` | Generate x402 API project | Always safe |
| `scaffold_x402_ai_endpoint` | Generate x402 AI API project | Always safe |
