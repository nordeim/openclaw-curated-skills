## Correlation Discovery Process

When you find a potential correlation:

1. **Verify the logic**: Is the relationship actually guaranteed?
2. **Check resolution criteria**: Do both markets resolve the same way?
3. **Calculate historical spread**: What's normal?
4. **Set arb threshold**: At what spread is it worth trading?
5. **Document edge cases**: What could break the correlation?

### Common Correlation Types

**Implication (A → B)**:
If A happens, B must happen. Therefore P(A) <= P(B).
Example: "Trump wins Iowa" → "Trump wins nomination" (probably)

**Subset**:
A is contained within B. Therefore P(A) <= P(B).
Example: "Event in January" vs "Event in Q1"

**Sum to 100%**:
Mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive options.
Example: All candidates in a race

**Inverse**:
P(A) = 1 - P(B)
Example: YES and NO on same market (minus fees)

**Conditional**:
P(A|B) relationship exists
Example: "X wins if Y happens"
