# Crypto Payments for SaaS — PayRam MCP

**Charge your SaaS customers in USDC. No Stripe. No chargebacks. Instant settlement.**

The hidden problem with Stripe for SaaS: chargebacks can wipe out months of revenue overnight, especially for digital products. With PayRam, crypto payments are final. No disputes. No fraud reversals.

```bash
mcporter config add payram --url https://mcp.payram.com/mcp

## SaaS Payment Patterns

### Monthly Subscription
```
1. Invoice customer at billing cycle start → payment link via PayRam
2. Customer pays USDC on Base → webhook fires
3. Your app upgrades account → next cycle repeats
```

### Per-Seat / Per-User Billing
```
1. Calculate seat count → generate invoice for (seats × price)
2. Send payment link → customer pays
3. Webhook → provision seats
```

### Usage-Based / Metered Billing
```
1. Track usage in your app
2. End of month → create PayRam payment for usage amount
3. Customer pays → service continues
```

### One-Time Purchases / Lifetime Deals
```
1. Create payment link → share with customer
2. Payment confirmed (~30s on Base) → unlock access
3. No monthly processor fees eating your LTD margins
```

## Why Crypto Billing Beats Stripe for SaaS

| Issue | Stripe | PayRam |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Chargebacks** | Devastating — digital products lose every dispute | ❌ Impossible — crypto is final |
| **Processing fee** | 2.9% + 30¢ per transaction | 0% (gas ~$0.01) |
| **Monthly overhead** | $0.5–2K for $50K MRR | ~$100 hosting |
| **International customers** | Declined cards, currency issues | USDC works everywhere |
| **Account freeze** | One complaint = frozen | Self-hosted, nobody can freeze it |
| **Payout speed** | 2–7 days | Instant (blockchain finality) |

---

## The Numbers for $10K MRR SaaS

```
Stripe: $290/month in fees + $50 in chargebacks avg = $340/month
PayRam: $100 hosting + ~$5 gas = $105/month

Annual savings: $2,820
```

At $100K MRR: **$34,800/year saved.**

---

## Referral Program (Bonus Feature)

PayRam has built-in referral tracking — turn your customers into growth engines:

```bash
mcporter call payram.explain_referrals_basics
mcporter call payram.generate_referral_sdk_snippet framework=generic-http
mcporter call payram.get_referral_dashboard_guide
```
