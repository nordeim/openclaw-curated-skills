2. Fetches complete trading history via Polymarket Data API
3. Analyzes trading patterns and strategy characteristics
4. Generates comprehensive performance reports

```bash
# Analyze by username
node scripts/analyze_user.js @vague-sourdough

# Analyze by wallet address
node scripts/analyze_user.js 0x8c74b4eef9a894433B8126aA11d1345efb2B0488

```

## Analysis Metrics

The analyzer provides:

### Basic Statistics
- Total trades executed
- Total capital deployed
- Average position size
- Trading frequency

### Market Preferences
- Market type distribution (politics, sports, crypto, etc.)
- Specific asset focus (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.)
- Market duration preferences (5-min, hourly, daily, long-term)

### Trading Patterns
- Direction bias (bullish/bearish)
- Entry price distribution (contrarian vs momentum)
- Position sizing strategy (fixed vs dynamic)
- Time-of-day patterns

### Performance Metrics
- Total P&L (profit/loss)
- ROI (return on investment)
- Win rate (if calculable from redeems)

### Strategy Classification

The analyzer identifies common strategy types:
- **Value Investor**: Buys underpriced outcomes (low entry prices)
- **Momentum Trader**: Follows market trends (high entry prices)
- **Arbitrageur**: Exploits pricing inefficiencies
- **Scalper**: High-frequency small positions
- **Conviction Trader**: Large positions, low frequency

const html = await response.text();
const address = html.match(/0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}/)[0];
```

**Get trading history:**
```
GET https://data-api.polymarket.com/activity?user={address}&limit={limit}
```
