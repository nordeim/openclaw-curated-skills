# 🎯 Customer Support Command Center — by AfrexAI

Turn your AI agent into a full support operations lead. Not just polite replies — real ticket triage, escalation workflows, CSAT tracking, churn prevention, and knowledge base management.

## What This Does

- **Ticket triage** with priority matrix (P0-P3) and smart routing rules
- **HEARD response framework** with 6 ready-to-use templates for every situation
- **Escalation workflow** with clear triggers and handoff templates
- **CSAT & metrics tracking** — weekly dashboards, red flag alerts, NPS monitoring
- **Churn prevention system** — risk scoring (0-100), retention playbook, save offers by MRR tier
- **Knowledge base management** — article templates, weekly hygiene checklist
- **Automation rules** — auto-routing, canned responses, confidence-gated auto-replies
- **Edge cases covered** — GDPR, abuse handling, multi-channel, VIP/enterprise, international

## Install

```bash
clawhub install afrexai-customer-support
```

## Quick Start

Tell your agent: *"A customer emailed saying their dashboard has been loading for 5 minutes and they have a demo in 30 minutes"*

Watch it: triage as P1, draft a HEARD-method response, flag for engineering escalation, and set an SLA timer.

## What Makes This Different

Most support skills give you "be empathetic" advice. This gives you:
- A **100-point churn risk scoring system** with intervention playbooks
- **Retention offers calibrated by MRR** ($100 vs $2K accounts get different treatment)
- **Weekly reporting templates** ready for leadership
- **Ticket routing YAML** you can adapt to your actual team structure
- **Real templates** — not "write something nice," but actual copy you customize
