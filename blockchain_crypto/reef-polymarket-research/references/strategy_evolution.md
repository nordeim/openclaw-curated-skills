### Active Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Min Edge | 5% | Below this, skip |
| Max Position | 10% | Of portfolio |
| Kelly Fraction | 0.25 | Quarter Kelly |
| Research Time Min | 30 min | Per trade |
| Confidence Threshold | Medium+ | For full size |

### Category Focus

| Category | Priority | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| Politics | High | Good data availability, learnable |
| Crypto | Medium | Domain familiarity, but volatile |
| Sports | Low | Sharp competition |
| Entertainment | Low | High variance |

### Research Process (Current)

1. Screen markets for volume/liquidity
2. Initial thesis formation (15 min)
3. Deep research (30-60 min)
4. Probability estimation with confidence
5. Edge calculation and sizing
6. Document and execute

## Evolution History

### Iteration #0 - Initial Setup

**Methodology**: Standard research-based probability estimation

**Hypotheses to Test**:
1. Better information aggregation beats market
2. Base rates are underweighted by market
3. Calibration improves with deliberate practice
4. 5% min edge is appropriate threshold

**Key Questions**:
- What's my Brier score?
- Which categories offer most edge?
- Am I over/underconfident?
- How much research is optimal?
