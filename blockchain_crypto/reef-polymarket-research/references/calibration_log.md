# Probability Calibration Log

**CLAWDBOT INSTRUCTION**: Track all probability estimates vs outcomes to improve calibration. Being well-calibrated is essential for long-term profitability.

## What is Calibration?

If you say something has a 70% probability, it should happen 70% of the time.

- **Overconfident**: You say 80%, but it happens only 60% of the time
- **Underconfident**: You say 60%, but it happens 80% of the time
- **Well-calibrated**: Your estimates match reality

## Calibration Adjustment Factor

Based on your calibration analysis, apply this adjustment:

```
Adjusted Probability = Raw Estimate × Adjustment Factor

Current Adjustment Factor: 1.0 (no adjustment - update based on data)
```

## Brier Score Tracker

Brier Score = (1/N) × Σ(forecast - outcome)²

Where:
- forecast = your probability (0 to 1)
- outcome = 1 if happened, 0 if not

Lower is better:
- 0.00 = Perfect
- 0.25 = Random guessing on 50/50
- 0.50 = Terrible

**Running Brier Score**: N/A (no predictions yet)

### Brier Score by Category

| Category | Predictions | Brier Score |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Politics | 0 | N/A |
| Crypto | 0 | N/A |
| Sports | 0 | N/A |
| Entertainment | 0 | N/A |
| Other | 0 | N/A |

## Calibration Curve

Plot your actual outcomes vs predicted probabilities.

## Calibration Analysis

### After Every 20 Predictions

Run this analysis:

1. **Overall Brier Score**: Calculate and compare to baseline
2. **By Bucket**: Which ranges am I best/worst at?
3. **By Category**: Which topics am I best calibrated on?
4. **Trend**: Am I improving over time?

### Calibration Adjustments Made

| Date | Old Adjustment | New Adjustment | Based On |
|------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| [INITIAL] | 1.0 | 1.0 | Starting point |

## Common Calibration Errors

Track which errors you make:

### Overconfidence Triggers
- [e.g., "When I feel certain about politics"]
- [e.g., "When confirming evidence is strong"]

### Underconfidence Triggers
- [e.g., "When going against the crowd"]
- [e.g., "In areas where I've been wrong before"]

### Fixes Applied
- [e.g., "When estimate >80%, ask: what would make this wrong?"]
- [e.g., "Always check base rate before intuition"]
