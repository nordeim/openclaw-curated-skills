# Migration: The Art of Strategic Deferral 🔄

## Migration Is Not Failure

**Traditional view:** "I didn't finish this task. I failed."  
**BuJo view:** "I strategically deferred this task based on priorities."

## Types of Migration

### 1. Daily Migration (`>`)
**To:** Tomorrow's daily log  
**When:** Still relevant, not urgent, you're out of time/energy  
**Mindset:** "This matters, but not today"

### 2. Future Migration (`<`)
**To:** Specific future date  
**When:** Has a deadline or makes more sense later  
**Mindset:** "This has its time"

### 3. Collection Migration
**To:** A themed collection (ideas, reading list, etc.)  
**When:** Not actionable yet, but worth keeping  
**Mindset:** "This is an idea, not a task"

### 4. Completion During Migration (`×`)
**To:** Done list  
**When:** You realize it doesn't need to be a task  
**Mindset:** "This was already done / not needed"

### 5. Dropping (~~strikethrough~~)
**To:** Deleted  
**When:** Not happening, admit it  
**Mindset:** "This was aspirational, not real"

## The Migration Decision Tree

```
Incomplete Task:
  |
  ├─ Still relevant?
  |    ├─ YES → Continue
  |    └─ NO  → Drop it (~~)
  |
  ├─ Has specific future date?
  |    ├─ YES → Schedule (<)
  |    └─ NO  → Continue
  |
  ├─ Still urgent/important?
  |    ├─ YES → Migrate to tomorrow (>)
  |    └─ NO  → Move to collection
  |
  └─ Actually done?
       └─ YES → Complete it now (×)
```

## Migration Anti-Patterns

### The Migration Trap
**Problem:** Same task migrates 10 days in a row  
**Cause:** Task is too big, unclear, or you're avoiding it  
**Solution:** 
- Break it into micro-steps
- Ask: "What am I avoiding?"
- Move to 💀 Dread Tasks collection with support plan

### The Aspirational Migration
**Problem:** Tasks migrate indefinitely "someday"  
**Cause:** Task isn't actually a priority  
**Solution:**
- Be honest: "Am I going to do this?"
- If no → Drop it
- If yes → Schedule specific date

### The Migration Guilt
**Problem:** Feeling bad about migrating  
**Cause:** Thinking migration = failure  
**Solution:**
- Reframe: "I'm prioritizing effectively"
- Track: "How many tasks did I migrate strategically?"
- Celebrate: "I made conscious choices about my time"

## Weekly Migration Ritual

**Sunday evening or Monday morning:**

1. **Gather** all week's daily logs
2. **Review** all migrated tasks (`>`)
3. **Decide** for each:
   - This week's priority? → Add to weekly list
   - Specific day? → Schedule with `<`
   - Not this week? → Move to monthly/future log
   - Not happening? → Drop it
4. **Note patterns:** What keeps migrating? Why?

## Monthly Migration Ritual

**End of month:**

1. **Review** month's weekly migrations
2. **Identify** recurring migrations (system issue?)
3. **Archive** completed work
4. **Plan** next month's focus areas

## Migration Statistics to Track

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| Migration rate | % tasks migrated vs completed |
| Recurring migrations | Tasks that migrate 3+ times |
| Drop rate | % tasks dropped (healthy if >10%) |
| Same-day completion | % tasks done same day planned |

**Healthy ranges:**
- Migration rate: 20-40% (some flexibility is good)
- Recurring migrations: <10% of tasks (avoidance indicator)
- Drop rate: 10-20% (honest prioritization)

## Migration Journal Prompts

At week's end, ask:

1. **What kept migrating?**
   - Is it too big? Break it down.
   - Is it unclear? Rewrite it.
   - Am I avoiding it? 💀 Dread task protocol.

2. **What did I drop?**
   - Was that the right choice?
   - Did I drop things I should have done?

3. **What patterns emerge?**
   - Certain days I complete more?
   - Certain types of tasks migrate more?
   - Energy patterns affecting completion?

## The Migration Mindset Shift

**From:** "I failed to finish 5 tasks today"  
**To:** "I strategically prioritized and completed the most important work"

**From:** "I keep putting this off"  
**To:** "This task needs to be redefined or supported"

**From:** "My todo list is never-ending"  
**To:** "I maintain a dynamic, prioritized capture system"

## Migration Phrases to Use

Instead of | Try
-----------|----
"I didn't finish this" | "I deferred this strategically"
"I failed to do this" | "I chose other priorities"
"This is still on my list" | "This is queued for appropriate timing"
"I keep procrastinating" | "This needs redefinition or support"

## Migration Is Success

Every migration is:
- ✅ A conscious prioritization decision
- ✅ Honesty about capacity
- ✅ Trust in your future self
- ✅ Flexibility in action

**The goal isn't zero migrations. The goal is intentional migrations.**
