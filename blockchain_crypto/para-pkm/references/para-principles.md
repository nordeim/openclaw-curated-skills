# PARA Method Principles

Source: https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/

## The Four Categories

**Projects**: Tasks linked to a goal with deadline → completes → Archives
**Areas**: Sphere of activity with standard to maintain → never "completed"
**Resources**: Topics of ongoing interest → reference material, no action required
**Archives**: Inactive items from other three categories

## Core Principles

1. **Organize by actionability**: Projects (deadline) > Areas (maintenance) > Resources (reference) > Archives (inactive)
2. **Start with Projects**: Ask "What am I committed to now?" Put rest in Resources temporarily
3. **One home per item**: Use links to connect, avoid duplicating content
4. **Move between categories**: Resources→Projects (activated), Projects→Archives (completed), Projects→Areas (becomes ongoing)
5. **Keep it simple**: Minimal subcategorization, max 2-3 levels depth

## PARA vs Other Systems

- **vs Zettelkasten**: PARA=action-oriented folders, Zettelkasten=connection-oriented notes
- **vs GTD**: GTD=task/context-based, PARA=project/area-based (complementary)
- **vs Topic folders**: Topic=by subject, PARA=by actionability (surfaces what's relevant)

## Common Questions

- **Project or Area?** Does it have an end state? Yes→Project, No→Area
- **Subcategories?** Projects: minimal | Areas: by domain | Resources: by topic
- **Multiple categories?** Choose most actionable, link between them
- **Client work?** Fixed engagement→Projects | Ongoing retainer→Areas | Both valid

## Anti-Patterns

- **Inbox folder**: Capture directly to appropriate category (unsure→Resources)
- **Deep nesting**: Max 2-3 levels (`areas/business/operations/invoicing.md` good, deeper bad)
- **Topic organization**: Organize by action, not `work/personal/hobbies/`
- **Perfectionism**: Wrong location > no organization; refine over time
