## Technical Inspiration

### OpenViking (ByteDance)

The L0/L1/L2 hierarchy structure and context management paradigm in claw-memory-lite draws significant inspiration from ByteDance's open-source project **OpenViking**.

While claw-memory-lite implements a simplified and lightweight version tailored specifically for OpenClaw, the foundational ideas of tiered context loading and hierarchical memory organization come from the OpenViking team's excellent work.
